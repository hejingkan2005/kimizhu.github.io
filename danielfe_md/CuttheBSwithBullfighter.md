My favorite new piece of software is
[Bullfighter](http://www.dc.com/bullfighter/#) from [Deloite Touche
Consulting](http://www.dc.com). It's a Microsoft Word add-in (2000 or
XP) which searches your documents for terms like "synergy", "value
proposition", and "paradigm" that managers and consultants use to sound
smarter. I tried this tool on one of our latest [press
releases](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2003/Jun03/06-17SpamEnforcementPR.asp)
and found six "BS" hits. Sweet\! I only wish they had a web interface
(or web service interface) where you could point to a URL and get a BS
word count from a company's "About" page or quarterly earnings.

On the other side of the net, if you want to bloat your language, visit
Vanderbuilt's [MBA
Writer](http://www.mba.vanderbilt.edu/Mike.Shor/Humor/MBAWriter/) . My
auto-generated MBA sentence was: *"In line with heuristic policy
flexibility, leveraging customer positions leads the way with the
ramifications of the final results."* I'm making this my Mission
Statement.

There's also a great dictionary for [Corporate
Cliches](http://www.clieuk.co.uk/ccmain.htm).
