The Middle East Developer's Conference was lots of fun, I only wish I
had more time to enjoy Egypt.  I presented two sessions, one on ASP.NET
Whidbey and the other on C\# Language Enhancements.  The people at the
conference were great and there were lots of great questions and
discussion after the sessions.  I also got to meet up with some Regional
Directors that I hadn't known before including
[Stephen Forte](http://www.stephenforte.net) (of
[Orcsweb](http://www.orcsweb.com/) fame),
[Malek Kemmou](http://www.malekkemmou.ma/) (who answers the age-old
question of what is the [Sphinx looking
at](http://www.malekkemmou.ma/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ff30d93f-4cd6-401b-8d23-f46ec4864f31)),
and Patrick Hynds. I'll discuss my demos in a later post, as I'm still
unburying from the over 600 new emails I got while away for three days.
