NOTE: If you've been forwarded a link to this blog post, it's likely
that one of your colleagues thinks you should do your due diligence
before thinking a contest is the fastest road to salvation. It isn't,
here's why...

I'm starting a crusade at Microsoft to lower the number of contests we
run a year. I know I'll be successful if the number of contests a year
goes down. I fear I won't be. First, let me explain by showing how bad
the problem is.

**The Problem  
**Today is March 17th, and there are already **** **\*~~18\*~~ 30**
contests that will finish this year. That's 1.6 contests a week. Mind
you, this is only after a cursory search and it does not include
Microsoft partner contests (large companies like HP, community sites
like codeproject, etc).

That's a \*lot\* of contests. Most customers don't even know that half
of these exist. In fact, I only knew of about five of them, but still
teams are out there building another contest page and even having
contests for the same customer base overlapping each other. I wonder if
you could live off of just entering Microsoft contests...it's never the
same teams evaluating your project, idea, etc... Perhaps I should run a
contest to have one person try to win every Microsoft contest :)

**Why do teams run contests?**

While this depends on the group, here are some of the most common
reasons

  - **Community** - Grow a community or get the community involved in a
    technology -
  - **Content** - Get samples built using a technology
  - **Testing** - Test a pre-alpha application
  - **Usage** - Drive usage of a new product or service

**Contests to Drive Community  
**Running a contest to grow a community is probably one of the worst
reasons why to run a contest. First off, a contest pits users
<span class="underline">*against*</span> users rather than having users
work *<span class="underline">with</span>* each other. It forces what
are considered equal members to be subdivided based on their skills or
aptitude. It's not the healthiest thing to do and it certainly doesn't
grow your community.

**Contests to Drive Content  
**Another common reason is to have content built using your technology.
There are a couple of reasons why this isn't a good idea, including:

1.  Not Shareable - You did not setup your contest so that the projects
    themselves would be open source projects and available to everyone
2.  Licensing - The content makes use of things like GPL code or
    components which may bar the Microsoft team from using it elsewhere
3.  Poorly written The content is built with poor programming standards
4.  Fragile bits - The content is built on an alpha or beta version and
    likely won't work with the final release
5.  Wrong audience - The audience for the technology is ISVs or VARs
    that really don't want to share code that they could use/resell

The goal is to drive some form of behavior and in many cases, it's
decided by a product manager for a specific technology that really just
wants applications and samples to be built using that technology and to
drive PR.   

**Contests to Drive Testing  
**Things like a bug bash are probably some of the best suited for
contests as it is really more of a reward for helping test an
application. The only issues with testing is that depending on the
software's complexity, the end result of a bug bash or extra testing end
is likely to be documenting the issue in a "known issues" or "readme"
document and punting the bug for the next service pack 6-8 months later.
If the software is smaller, say like a starter kit or sample versus
Windows 7, then most of the bugs found will actually be fixed by the
time the sample ships.  

**Contests to Drive Usage  
**Usage can be a mixed bag, depending on the service. In many cases, it
can drive the wrong behavior, like having hundreds of people sign up for
a service that they will never use, just for a chance to win a
sweepstakes. The important thing to remember is that you want to drive
the right behavior with the right audience. In many cases, customers
will jump through whatever hoops necessary to win your "prize" and
things like free online services are the most likely to be abused.  

**Contest Realities**

  - Contests drive no PR to your product (with few exceptions). Look at
    Google and Apple, they smartly do very few contests, about 1-3 a
    year and they get great press out of them versus the 30-50
    department contests we do.
  - Customers are already inundated by existing contests, why will yours
    rise to the top?
  - Contests may only have a limited number of entrants (20-30). That
    means your $5,000 in prizes and an additional $10,000 in demand
    generation, site design, legal fees, etc was a very ineffective
    spend for such a small audience. You could get more customers by
    handing out $100 bills at Best Buy
  - Contests that do have lots of entries \>1,000 require a massive
    level of effort to sift through and measure each entry. You better
    have planned for a lot of logistical time in reviewing each and
    every entry and how to deal with international entries that may have
    parts that aren't in English (assuming you're doing a worldwide
    contest). Judging is a huge, huge time sync and something that would
    be better used actually talking with or interacting with customers.

**What else can I do besides contests?  
**This depends on your goal, but if your goal is

Increase Community Participation - Don't spend money, spend your time
engaging customers in your product/service or related community. This
could mean 3rd party communities as well

Increase Content

  - Product Team: See if you can drive your product team to have an "App
    Week" where they build content that you would want
  - RDs/MVPs/Student Partners: There are many existing "experts" that
    don't have a blue badge. In many cases, they're more than happy to
    help you identify and build content for your product/service, but
    price and quality do vary between groups
  - Outsource: There are tons of content experts that exist in the
    world, ask your colleagues who a reputable vendor is for your
    product/technology and you'll likely find that the cost for a great
    use of your technology would cost the same, if not cheaper, than
    running a contest and without any of the associated issues

Drive Usage

  - Instead of "bribing" someone into using your product, spend money on
    making sure your target audience is aware of your offering
    (advertising/promotion), talk to influencers and see if they'd be
    willing to try and evaluate your product/service, find another
    organization to partner with that makes sense, or spend the money on
    improving the product through "unofficial" features that would make
    customers \*want\* to use your product.

    you could be doing to achieve the same goal
