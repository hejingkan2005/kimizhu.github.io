After 3 hours of sleep (re - broken demos) I woke up to hit the
Convention Center in Dallas.  I finally met
[Juval](http://www.microsoftregionaldirectors.com/Extranet/DirectorDetails.aspx?did=1146)
in person while checking in at registration, and I think there are about
5 cardboard cutouts of Juval around all of TechEd.  More on that later. 
My first presentation was to faculty and you can find out more
information about it on
[Morris's](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/morriss/PermaLink.aspx/f8a5b8cc-dba6-4e05-ad20-4e007c3d5b10)
blog, and also what happenned to me minutes before I spoke on
[Brian's](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/briankel/PermaLink.aspx/51056c03-c1df-4ca5-8f05-8bdcb8626fee)
log.  My laptop has since recovered.  After this I gave a quick talk to
[RD](http://www.microsoft.com/rd/)'s on generics which was fun (I like
these people), and then hit the Circle Ranch afterwards.  After some
good barbeque and a
[shooting](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/briankel/PermaLink.aspx/bc708744-de59-4e9a-b5ab-8b0b3f6e3681),
I got to meet a lot of cool people in the community and even met and
drink with [Drew](http://www.drewby.net) who runs
[TechEdBloggers](http://www.techedbloggers.net) in person.  

Speaking of TechEdBloggers, the bloggers meeting is tonight from 7-8pm
in Room A118. Be there :)

The rest of the night is under NDA, but I now know that people from
Dallas, Microsoft, and event attendees know how to have a good time:)
