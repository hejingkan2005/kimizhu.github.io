I've been hustling and bustling, spreading the word about Visual Studio
Express as usual.

  - **July 21 MGX, Orlando **(Internal only, Microsoft Global Exchange)
    - All public demos are on
    [Coding4Fun](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/).
  - **July 25 - Microsoft Intern Fair, Redmond**: John and I did the dog
    & pony show, all public demos are on
    [Coding4Fun](http://msdn.mirosoft.com/coding4fun/) and on Channel9,
    you can find [Ivan Mladenov's DIY Junktop Revival
    project](https://channel9.msdn.com/wiki/default.aspx/Channel9.JunktopRevival)
  - **July 26 - [LSites.org
    session](http://www.lsites.org)**, Seattle: This one was
    interesting as I got to present and hear from folks in the education
    space who are interested building the skills necessary for students
    to enter the workforce. My advice is to find folks who can think
    outside the box and who have decent communication skills.
  - **August 12 - Student Ambassadors**, Redmond: Our Student
    Ambassadors rock, besides being really bright, they have an innate
    passion for technology.
  - **September 4 -11 - [TechEd
    Malaysia](http://www.microsoft.com/malaysia/techedsea2006/)**, Kuala
    Lumpur: I'm bringing Angie (the wife) along to Kuala Lumpur where
    I'll be giving two talks, a C\# Tips and Tricks and a session
    dedicated to Coding4Fun with some cool new apps I've been tinkering
    with. 

I'm really looking forward to TechEd Malaysia, both for the vacation
(we're also [taking some time off in
Langkawi](http://www.langkawi-resorts.com/fourseasons/)), and of course
to meet up with some of my favorite people like [Tim
Huckaby](http://blogs.interknowlogy.com/timhuckaby/) and [Matt
"Matty" Hardman](http://blogs.msdn.com/the_hardman/).
