Okay, I admit that it's **not** as fully featured as Notepad, but if you
want to learn about some of the IDE features in C\# 2005 and you're a
little hesitant to install beta software on your machin, then this
tutorial is for you.

**It's interactive\! ** Rather then reading an article or watching a
non-interactive video, this tutorial walks you through actually building
a simplified version of Notepad using Visual C\# Express. You'll learn
to:

  - [Create a User
    Interface](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/quicktour/ex1/)
  - [Write
    code](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/quicktour/ex2/)
  - [Debug and modify existing
    code](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/quicktour/ex3/)

The [Create a User
Interface](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/quicktour/ex1/)
portion you'll learn about the docking features, use the OpenFileDialog
control and use the and the new ToolStrip control to design the UI.
