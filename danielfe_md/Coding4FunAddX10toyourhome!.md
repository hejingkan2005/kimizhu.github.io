We've been waiting a while on this, but we officially released a new
Do-It-Yourself article series by [Tony
Northrup](http://www.northrup.org/), called [DIY with Tony
Northrup](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/diy/). In the first of
many videos, Tony shows how to install X10 at home.  In the follow up
article (coming soon), he'll show how you can use VB and C\# Express to
program your X10 lights\!\!

The hardest part about this was coming up with the name for the series.
We kicked around "Pimp My Home" and "This Old Geek House", but rejected
them for a couple of reasons, but the most salient being that Tony's
going to do lots more DIY topics then just X10. If you have ideas on new
videos, [email us](mailto:code4fun@microsoft.com)
