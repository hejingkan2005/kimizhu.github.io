[Mike Zintel, Compact
Framework](/mikezintel/archive/2006/03/14/550958.aspx) guru blogs about
getting ready for the Game Developer Conference next week:

*I also know that working with the Xbox team has been among the most
enjoyable and productive cross group work that I’ve done. I know that my
team and the XNA team within Xbox, have been burning the midnight oil to
allow us to demonstrate the feasibility of games written in managed code
running on a .NET CLR on a final 360 dev kit. And I know that we’ve
demonstrated the same game binary (almost the same; oh so close) running
on the 360 kit, Windows and on Windows Mobile.*

Then [David Weller chimes
in](http://www.inkblog.com/2006/03/15/Managed+DirectX+And+XNA.aspx)

*Speaking of XNA....we have some wicked cool stuff to announce and
demonstrate at the GDC.  We even have a prototype of a CLR-based
graphics app running on a 360 dev kit\!  Drool-tastic :P*

*I do want to say one thing about Tom's departure from the DirectX
team...it doesn't mean the end of DirectX support in the Common Language
Runtime.  Quite the opposite.  We love the CLR and we are seeing more
and more adoption and usage of the CLR in conjunction with DirectX
applications.  We will have some exciting announcements in the not too
distant future about where we are going along that path.  Stay tuned\!*

In Summary: I. Love. This. Company.
