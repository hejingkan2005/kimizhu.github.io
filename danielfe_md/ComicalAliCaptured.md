The Mirror is reporting that "[Comical
Ali](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/24by7panews/page.cfm?objectid=13107136&method=full&siteid=50143)"
has been captured .  He's become quite the internet icon, on par with
[AllYourBase](http://www.planettribes.com/allyourbase/AYB2.swf),
[Mahir](http://www.salon.com/tech/log/1999/11/04/mahir/), and even the
[HampterDance](http://www.hampsterdance.com/hampsterdanceredux.html). The
Iraqi Information Minister even has a [best-of
DVD](http://www.comicalalidvd.com/) and a
[fan](http://www.welovetheiraqiinformationminister.com/mss_history.html)
site. You have to love the internet :)
