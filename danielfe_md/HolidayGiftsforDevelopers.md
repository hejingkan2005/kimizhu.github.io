Tis the season of giving, and well, if you're a developer, wouldn't you
like to receive gifts that you can actually play around with and write
code against? Wouldn't it be great if there was an online
guide highlighting extensible hardware and software for
developers?

Yes, it's the first of its kind, the [Coding4Fun Holiday Gift
Guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/holiday/giftguide/default.aspx).
What makes our gift guide one-of-a-kind? Well, almost all of the gifts
have an API that you can programatically write code with, and where
possible, we've included code samples or documentation to help you can
get started.
