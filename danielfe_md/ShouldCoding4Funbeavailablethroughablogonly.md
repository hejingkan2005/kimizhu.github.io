If you're a Coding4Fun reader, please respond\!

 

Earlier this week, I asked our Coding4Fun authors what they thought
about moving Coding4Fun to being fully blog-based a la
[Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/),
[Make](http://www.makezine.com/blog/), etc.

Many Coding4Fun readers don't know this, but Coding4Fun actually uses
<http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/> as its back-end blog engine and the
MSDN presence at <http:///msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/>  is really a
“skin” if you will of that engine. Rather than having two sites, we’re
considering on moving solely to <http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun> with
our msdn site still existing but it would just redirect to the blog.  

 

Why do this?

 

**Advantages of moving to primarily a blog option**

  - Built-in C4F only search so you can actually find articles
  - No formatting weirdness between sites where code looks good on the
    blog, but crappy on the MSDN site
  - No more disappearing articles where old articles can't be found
    because they are no longer visible through the RSS feed
  - Deeper categorization/tags – we can provide a much more thorough
    list of tags than we do today
  - Built-in comments so you can share your thoughts on articles
  - Easier to find in search engines
  - Less work for authors to publish
  - Version resilience – MSDN is moving to an new infrastructure that
    would tie up our dev resources
  - We would still have article redirection in place for previously
    published articles that would point to the blog
  - Printer-friendly articles, assuming we stick to some high-level
    authoring guidelines

**Disadvantages of moving to primarily a blog option**

  - Less control over the UI Frame – It may not be as “sexy” a UI,
    although we’ll likely be able to get a custom blog skin
  - Article URLs would be on <http://blogs.msdn.com> instead of
    <http://msdn.microsoft.com>
