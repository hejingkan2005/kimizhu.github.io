From the research web site:

*The Spec\# programming system is a new attempt at a more cost effective
way to develop and maintain high-quality software.   The system consists
of:*

  - *A programming methodology, which includes a sound treatment of
    object invariants in object-oriented programs.*
  - *The Spec\# programming language, which is a superset of C\# and
    adds things like non-null types, checked exceptions, method
    contracts (like pre- and postconditions), and object invariants.*
  - *The Spec\# compiler, which is integrated into the Microsoft Visual
    Studio development environment, statically enforces non-null types,
    emits run-time checks for method contracts and invariants, and
    records the specifications in metadata for consumption by the
    program verifier.*
  - *The Spec\# static program verifier, which translates programs into
    logical verification conditions, which are passed to an automatic
    theorem prover.*
  - *An interface to the SpecExplorer tool for test generation and
    model-based testing.*

If you've ever read the [Pragmatic
Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/020161622X?v=glance)
or done contract-based programming before with tools like
[iContract](http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2001/jw-0216-cooltools.html),
you'll instantly see the value of pre- and post- conditions for code.
