From [memefirst](http://www.memefirst.com/000446.html), we see the power
of one of the most powerful substances in the world, the cocoa bean.
According to this article, it's strong enough to either make you divulge
your password or lie to a researcher.  As a chocoholic who needs at
least a hershey kiss to “cleanse the pallette“ after a meal, I can
attest to its awesome power.   

[*71% of
Londoners*](http://www.enterpriseitplanet.com/security/news/article.php/3342871 "http://www.enterpriseitplanet.com/security/news/article.php/3342871")
*accosted in the street divulged their passwords for a bar of chocolate,
according to a survey done by an IT security group hoping for precisely
that alarmist outcome.*

*My own conclusion from this research: 29% of Londoners are decent folk
not willing to take advantage of gullible researchers; and a whopping
71% of Londoners will gladly lie to strangers for food. Also, 100% of
the researchers in this survey should be ashamed of themselves.*

PS: The best spa I've ever been to is the [spa at Hotel
Hershey](http://www.hersheypa.com/accommodations/the_spa_at_hotel_hershey/).
If you haven't been to [Hershey
Park](http://www.hersheypa.com/attractions/hersheypark/), you should go
and you should definitely take in the spa, you'll thank me later.
