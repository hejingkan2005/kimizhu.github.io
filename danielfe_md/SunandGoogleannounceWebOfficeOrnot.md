The cat is finally out of the proverbial bag. [Details here
"soon"](http://www.sun.com/events/google/).

**Edit**: Man, was I (and a [lot of the
Web)](http://slashdot.org/articles/05/10/04/1234229.shtml?tid=102&tid=217)
wrong. Sun and Google hold a major press conference to announce, get
ready to sit down for this, the [Google Toolbar with Java Runtime
Environment (JRE)](http://www.sun.com/2005-1004/feature/index.html). I
really have to say this is the biggest "nothing" announcement I've seen
in a while. While I respect the guys at Sun and Google, do you really
think Jonathan's Schwartz statement "*the world is about to change this
week"* is accurate?

I'd be really interested to see how much of Google is running using
Java, but I suspect the vast majority is actually in C++. As a company
they used to be technology agnostic, some examples below

  - The Google Toolbar, the piece they're distributing with the JRE is
    written in C++, not Java
  - The [Google
    Deskbar](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/partnerpack/desc/google.htm)
    is written using the .NET Framework 1.1
  - [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com) is written in ASP.NET

Will there be a more compelling announcement in the future? Let's hope
so
