In my previous post on [Music, Seattle, and the
Web](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/08/05/209070.aspx), my
loyal blog readers (I still respect you all even if the majority of you
[actually like candy
corns](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/10/29/249894.aspx#FeedBack)) gave
some great recommendations for online music in the comments.

One of the links I included was to a [mix by DJ
Bolivia](http://www.mta.ca/pub/music/she_dances.ram), who personally
emailed me and sent me a link to [another
mix](http://www.djbolivia.ca/bolivia.html#evolve2004) that I might
enjoy. How **cool** is that?\!

It gets better, Jonathan, er DJ Bolivia ([web
site](http://www.djbolivia.ca/)) and I started exchanging emails and I
told him how I always wanted a mix specifically for developers
considering how much time we spend listening to music. DJ Bolivia, to my
surprise, had some programming experience and decided to take me up on
the offer of creating a mix for developers\!\!

[**"I Never Expected
This"**](http://www.djbolivia.ca/bolivia.html#neverexpected) **- Music
to Code By, Vol. 1 of 3  
**64 minutes of Progressive/Tribal House.  
[Download the
MP3](http://www.mta.ca/pub/music/DJ%20Bolivia%20-%20I%20Never%20Expected%20This.mp3),
or [listen to the
stream](http://www.mta.ca/pub/music/never_expected.ram)

I thought the mix was great, what do you all think?
