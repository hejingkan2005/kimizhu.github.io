We' just announced [WebMatrix](http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/),
a new, simple IDE to build and customize Web sites.

As someone who believes we need to provide a better offering for
beginners and non-professional developers, WebMatrix, and specifically,
the Razor syntax is a huge leap forward. Given that most customers are
familiar with HTML and JavaScript, being able to have a concise,
lightweight and easy-to-use language (that still has the power of the
full .NET Framework) is huge.

In some sense, it’s a return to the simplicity of Classic ASP for
building Web pages.

**Here’s why I think it’s cool:**

  - **A Full Web Stack**: WebMatrix gives you the full stack, including
    IIS Express, SQL Compact Edition, deployment tools, and SEO
    reporting tools
  - **Perfect for Beginners**: If you’re new to ASP.NET or even new to
    coding, you can build a Web site using Razor in a weekend.
  - **Hoster-friendly**: You don’t need any special configuration for
    Razor syntax pages and even SQL Compact Edition just needs to be
    x-copied to your bin folder. The one hoster requirement is that they
    have the .NET Framework 4.0 installed
  - **Content Helpers**: Similar to VB’s My static classes/methods or
    Popfly’s blocks, Content Helpers wrap API’s, handy features, 3rd
    party services and much more.

 

Here’s a [Channel 9

Aside: The name WebMatrix isn’t actually new, it’s the same name of the
tool that existed before Visual Web Developer Express that was solely
for Web development.
