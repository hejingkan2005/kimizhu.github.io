In just the last couple of weeks, **2** of our
[Coding4Fun](http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/) authors became official
Microsoft employees. Congratulations to Scott and Clint and welcome to
the borg\!\!

 

  - [Scott's blog post: Blue
    Badge](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BlueBadge.aspx)
  - [Clint blog post: sell\_out(Clint,
    Microsoft)](http://betterthaneveryone.com/?p=585)

 

The good news is that both will continue to contribute articles to
Coding4Fun in the future and Clint will continue running the Coding4Fun
blog :)

 

Kudos to the ASP.NET (Scott) and the Academic Evangelism (Clint) teams
for hiring such smart guys.
