Thanks again to the 160+ of you who voted on the [Coding4Fun
redesign](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2006/09/20/763916.aspx)\! 
As you know, the Glass design took first place, but many of you loved
(and even emailed me) about Metal's icons and I liked them too and the
team at Personify Design has been working on incorporating these two
together into the final (for now) designs below: 

 This is what the home page will look like (roughly), it's Vista + Metal
icons and some of the Orange feedback thrown in too

**Coding4Fun Home
Page**

**Level 2 Sample: Gaming Sub Page**

Here is what the second level page would look like, say after you
clicked Gaming and your in the Gaming
section:

One thing to note here is that each of the categories above will have
its own icon (where the RSS icon is now).

 

**Next Steps**    
It's been terribly long since Coding4Fun has been updated. I'm sorry,
but we are trying to accelerate as much as possible here and we have
very cool content just itching for you to see. As such, we're doing what
we can to get the site up and running now and can work on refining
afterwards.

  - Our goal is to have the site up by Halloween at the absolute latest.
    Lots of folks are working hard to make this happen and there may be
    content bugs as all of the existing content needs to get pushed over
    to the Coding4Fun blog (aka our new publishing tool)
  - We're pushing most of our new samples (or updated samples) to the
    [Channel9
    Sandbox](https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=31) which
    should give folks a way to give feedback on the samples as well. 
  - We have some cool Halloween Coding4Fun articles in store for you too
    :)

 

**Feedback  
**Your feedback is always welcome on the design and/or ideas for future
articles.
