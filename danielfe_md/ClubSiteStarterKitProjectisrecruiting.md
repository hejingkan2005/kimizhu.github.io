Zack Owens is looking for volunteers to assist with a new open source
CodePlex project that builds onthe existing Club Site Starter Kit. Some
of the features he's looking to add include:

 

  - Bug Fixes
  - Forums
  - FCK Editor
  - Web Administration
  - Poll Control
  - RSS
  - AJAX
  - Themes
  - Searching
  - CMS-like text editing
  - News page formatted for printing
  - Selectable monthly, weekly, or daily calendar views
  - Calendar pages formatted for printing
  - ASPNETDB.mdf into the main DB
  - Blogs

 

The project is hosted on CodePlex at
<http://codeplex.com/ClubStarterKit/> and you can email Zack to join at:
<zowens@NOSPAM.eagleenvision.com>.

 

I'm definitely going to [track
progress](http://www.codeplex.com/ClubStarterKit/Project/ProjectRss.aspx)
on this one...if I had time to contribute, I would, specifically to add
a "League Module" that would enable a Club site to manage a league. You
could create multiple leagues with different skill levels (beginner,
int, advanced), add/manage teams on a specific skill level, add/manage
players on a specific team, add/manage the league schedule (auto
schedule generator would rock) and of course track all the league
standings including team and player stats. The challenge is in making
this generic enough so that you can have a hockey or baseball league, in
the same way that the [Collection Manager Starter
Kit](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/sql/starterkit/default.aspx#collection) is
multi-purpose.

 

In any case, sign up :)
