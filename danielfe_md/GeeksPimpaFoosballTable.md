I used to be a big foosball player a while back so I personally think
this is very cool. In this [Coding4Fun
article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/weekend/visualfoos/default.aspx),
the guys at [Clarity Consulting](http://www.claritycon.com/) used
[Ultimarc hardware](http://www.ultimarc.com/ipac1.html)Â to build an end
to end hi-tech foosball system with:

  - Scoring
  - Scheduling
  - Statistics
  - Audio Commentary using Speech API
  - Customized audio taunts
  - Instant replay with a
Webcam

I definitely think they need to add a way to track shot speed as well as
track which player scores and taunt the opposing team as appropriate.
For example, if an opposing goalie scores an end-to-end goal, it should
laugh and jeer the scored on team.
