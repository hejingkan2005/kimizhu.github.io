A customer recently emailed me asking why [Object Test
Bench](/danielfe/archive/2005/01/26/361375.aspx) doesn't work for Web
projects and it seems there isn't any documentation on this limitation
anywhere. In short, [Object Test
Bench](/danielfe/archive/2005/01/26/361375.aspx) (OTB) does \*not\* work
with Web projects. Due to a bug, OTB still shows as being an enabled
feature for Web projects when it should really be disabled. The OTB team
is looking to update the docs to call out this limitation so you don't
rack your brain trying to figure out what's wrong...
