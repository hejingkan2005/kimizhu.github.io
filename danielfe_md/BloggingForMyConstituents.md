One of my most important constituents, the Mrs. says that I haven't
blogged about her enough. 
[Goldfarb](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/bgold/) shares his wisdom that I
can either spend time with her or blog about her.  I agree, but
occasionally I'll find cool stuff that will help simplify her life (I
complicate it a bit so anything that helps is a good thing).  This
sounds too cool to not share: 

**Nail Color at the flick of a switch** from the
[Scotsman](http://www.news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=1238792003)

*"WOMEN will soon be able to change the colour of their nails at the
click of a switch. Researcher Carlos Gonzalez has been working on an
electrochromic false nail at the Cidetec research centre in Spain' s
Basque country. The hi-tech cosmetic accessory is fitted on top of the
natural nail and, once in place, can be changed to the colour of the
wearer's choice. The nail is made up of a number of superimposed layers,
which are sandwiched between various electrochromic polymers to allow
the colours to change.*"
