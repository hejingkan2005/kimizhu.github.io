I realized I haven't blogged for a while, and I needed to at least
mention my geeky Christmas gifts.  I traveled back east to DC for
Christmas and had a great time there with friends and family, then me &
the Mrs. celebrated New Year's eve in New York at
[Spirit](http://www.spiritnewyork.com) nightclub.  Oddly enough, I saw
someone who looked like [Chris Anderson](http://www.simplegeek.com)
circa 3am in the VIP section, but my memory and vision were a bit hazy
then, so I couldn't confirm, and walking up to someone and asking “are
you Chris Anderson?" seemed a bit weird even for New York.  I've also
only met Chris once, and it was during PDC on the rooftop of "[The
Standard](http://www.standardhotel.com)" hotel, and the conditions for
our conversation that night were equally hazy.  Anyways, I noticed a
couple of days later that Chris
[blogged](http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/4d5f4136-1278-40e9-a6b9-be8a3f0457a3)
(check Day 6) about celebrating New Year's at Spirit. What are the
chances?  Chris also went skating in Central Park, which we did too, as
did 1/2 of New York the day we went, but we had lots of fun anyways. 
Now on to the cool stuff I got for the holidays:

**Hardware**

  - AverMedia UltraTV - Cable and Radio PVR in one package, sweet :)
  - Sony MDR-NC5 Noise Canceling Headphone - These are a dream for
    flights with crying babies
  - [Mission
    D1](http://www.missionhockey.com/html/skates/04_rh_D1c.html) Roller
    Hockey Skates - These are a dream to skate on, love 'em, highly
    recommended.
  - [Targus Mobile Power
    Inverter](http://www.targus.com/us/product_details.asp?sku=PAPWR005U)
    - A necessity for anyone that travels by plane or by car.

**Media**

  - [Gladius](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/gladius/default.htm) (Xbox)
  - [Crimson Skies](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/crimsonskies/default.htm)
    (Xbox)
  - The Simpsons Seasons 2 & 3 - Best show ever
  - [The
    Office](http://www.bbcamericashop.com/default.asp?cpa=product&rpa=2&id=1877&mdm=DVD&AID=10273980&PID=1364346)

**Books**

  - [A Short History of Nearly
    Everything](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0767908171/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_2/102-9771136-1984951)
    - I was dissapointed by this book as it positions itself as a
    history of all things scientific, yet it goes into painful detail
    about the politics and infighting of lesser known scientists. I
    honestly don't care if Scientist A didn't like scientist B, instead
    tell me how they helped advanced science.
  - [Military History's Most
    Wanted](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/157488509X/qid=1073977279/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-9771136-1984951?v=glance&s=books)
    - This book is a list of lists on all things military including the
    greatest leaders to the most lop-sided victories in history.
  - [Encyclopedia of
    Hell](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0312244428/102-9771136-1984951?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=I16GM7AHZUJQSS&colid=3O1H5D2ZSU34D)
    - If Egon from [Ghostbusters](http://www.ghostbustershq.com) needed
    a real-life Tobin's spirit guide, the Encyclopedia of Hell would be
    a pretty good choice.  It's a good cross-cultural reference for all
    things about the nether region. Interesting reading
