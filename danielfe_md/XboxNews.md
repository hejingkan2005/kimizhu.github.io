**Halo 2  
**It looks like Bungie has officially stated on their [web
site](http://www.bungie.net/Games/Halo2/page.aspx?section=About&subsection=Main&page=1)
that Halo 2 will be released Fall 2004.  Halo 2 will be Xbox Live
enabled and it's going to be sweet.  I hope the
[Cornershot](http://www.cornershot.com/) gun makes it into Halo 3.

**EA to support Xbox Live?**   
[IGN is
reporting](http://xbox.ign.com/articles/508/508793p1.html?fromint=1)
that Electronic Arts, makers of games like The Sims, James Bond, LOTR,
Battlefield 1942, Medal of Honor, Ultima Online, and of course sports
titles for the NHL, NFL, MLB, NBA, and World Cup soccer would be
supporting Xbox Live. Excellent.
