Wow\!  Thomas Lewis who works on the ASP.NET evangelism team (and who
recently gave me some good feedback on starter kits) sends this gem from
[**Netcraft**](http://www.netcraft.com/).

*In this month's Web Server Survey the **<span class="underline">number
of IP addresses with sites using ASP.NET has overtaken those using JSP
and Java Servlets.</span>*** *The number of IP addresses found with
ASP.NET has shown **very strong growth in the past year with a 224%
increase from 17.2K to 55.8K**. JSP & Java Servlets despite being
overtaken is the next fastest growing in percentage terms with a 56%
increase.*

If you're keeping score at home, Java started in 1996. ASP.NET started
in 2002.  Within two years we're ahead, that's huge momentum\!
