After two months on the job, today I had my first meeting with our
Senior Vice President (and
[blogger](http://msdn.microsoft.com/blogs/ericr/)) [Eric
Rudder](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/ericr/default.asp)
*\[Note: Chris Sells also
[blogged](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/#myFirstVpMeeting) about
his first Eric Rudder meeting\]*.

We reviewed what the developer experience will be with the next version
of C\# and Visual Studio, and I can't tell you anything more then
that\<g\>.  The meeting went really well and everyone involved gave
good, candid, feedback that really focused on how we can make a truly
compelling experience for our core set of customers. I just know we're
going to make a lot of developers **\*really\*** happy.
