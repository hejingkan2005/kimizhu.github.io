Wohoo\!\! [Electronic Arts](http://www.ea.com) is fully supporting Xbox
live\!\!\! Gamespot has the [inside
scoop](http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/jamesbond007goldeneye2/news_6096976.html).

*“This evening at in Los Angeles, two of the biggest names in
games--Microsoft and Electronic Arts--announced a new partnership that
will fundamentally alter online console gaming.”  *

Here are just some of the games planned for Xbox live. Since I'm not a
big sports game player (with the exception of hockey), I'm really
looking forward to GoldenEye and the Battlefield title.

  - NCAA Football 2005
  - Madden NFL 2005
  - NBA Live 2005
  - FIFA Soccer 2005
  - NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup
  - Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005
  - NHL 2005? (Microsoft officials could not confirm whether NHL 2005
    would be Xbox Live-enabled)
  - Burnout 3
  - TimeSplitters Future Perfect
  - Need for Speed Underground 2
  - Battlefield: Modern Combat
