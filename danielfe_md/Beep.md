[Brad Abram's](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/BradA/) has been posting some
killer design guidelines on his blog which you should check out, and I
also noticed he posted a
useful [sample](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/BradA/permalink.aspx/387620b1-f891-4a71-baba-638c3d7722ac)
with different message beep types.  Scott Hanselman also included his
[sample](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/) from the Portland user
group.  Below is another easy way to do the PC beep which requires a
reference to the Microsoft.VisualBasic assembly: 

****

Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction.Beep();
