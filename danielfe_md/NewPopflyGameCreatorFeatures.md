[Adam Nathan](http://blogs.msdn.com/adam_nathan) recently blogged about
some of the new features they've added to Popfly Game Creator including
the color swapper for skinning actors, guidelines and snapping for
aligning characters, actor stamping for easier tiling, new events, and
the ability to clone a level\!

All-in-all, this should make building games using Popfly even easier.

Check out Adam's post for the [full
details](http://blogs.msdn.com/adam_nathan/archive/2008/06/12/new-game-creator-features-are-now-live.aspx).
