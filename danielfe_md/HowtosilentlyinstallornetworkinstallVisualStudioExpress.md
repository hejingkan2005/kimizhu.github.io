Aside: Aaron is one of the unspoken heroes for Express. For those of you
who don't know, if you don't uninstall Express in the correct order, bad
things happen. To help make this easier, Aaron had a tool to do this for
you (which was later changed and cleaned up by the setup team). I think
this is awesome primarily because this isn't even his job (he didn't
work for DevDiv at the time), he just went above and beyond and to this
day, he has the best most [detailed instructions on troubleshooting
setup](/astebner/articles/492809.aspx).
