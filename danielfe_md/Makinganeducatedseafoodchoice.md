Courtesy of [Jana](https://twitter.com/trucha33), next time you're out
to dinner with friends, remember to pull out your handy Seafood guide
provided [by Seafood
Watch](http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/seafoodwatch.asp) so that
you can make an educated choice on seafood entrees and
<span class="underline">avoid</span> over-farmed or
bad-for-the-environment choices.

Without it, you'd never know that folks on the west coast should avoid
Atlantic Cod, imported Swordfish (domestic is fine) or Yellowfin tuna.
If nothing else, whipping out the guide and letting your dinner party
aware of your intellectual seafood superiority. I suggest placing the
card in a front shirt pocket and raising it above your head like a
soccer (futbol) referee would signal a "Yellow Card."

 

Bonus points if you yell "Goooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal" if they order from
the approved seafood entree list.
