I'm still catching up on all things blogging, but since British Airways
gave me access to a computer in Heathrow (suckers\!), I figured I could
at least blog about new Microsoft bloggers that might interest you:

  - [Joe Nalewabau](http://blogs.msdn.com/joen) - C\# Program Manager
  - [Andy Pennell](http://blogs.msdn.com/andypennell) - C\# Developer
    Lead
  - [Geoff Snowman](http://blogs.msdn.com/gsnowman/) - Developer
    Community Champion (MD, DC, VA, WV, PA and DE)

Geoff and I used to work together in DC before I moved out to Seattle,
and reading his blog reminds me of how tough it is to have a job on the
road.  I have vivid memories of driving five hours to talk to a company
in West Virginia for about 45 minutes and then driving back five hours,
only to have to be in another city an additional three hours away the
next day.
