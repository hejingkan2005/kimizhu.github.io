Do you remember 1987? In the US, Whitney Houston's “I want to dance with
somebody“ and U2's “With or without you“ were at the top of the charts. 
Michael Douglas won the academy award for Best Actor for Wall Street,
and Broadcast News took home Best Picture.  I was but a gangly 10 year
old lad at the time, but I still remember them, ~~hundreds,~~
~~thousands,~~ *millions* of them, everywhere, in your hair, in your
food, in the air conditioning vents, everywhere - The 17-year cicadas
([**pic**](http://www.tennessean.com/local/archives/04/03/48368175.jpg)). Quote
from the [**WP
article**](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58972-2004Mar14.html)

*“Periodical cicadas, who've been underground for 17 years, will tunnel
out of the ground, fling their winged bodies through the air and sound
off day and night. Bug experts say their coming will be of biblical
proportions.”*  

Biblical proportions eh? Too bad I'm on the west coast and won't be able
to witness the swarms.

The Tennessean has [**more
information**](http://www.tennessean.com/local/archives/04/03/48362311.shtml?Element_ID=48362311)
and gives a good personal view of what its like to interact with cicadas
(its not pleasant).  For those of you who like [**Fear
Factor**](http://www.nbc.com/Fear_Factor/), you'll be delighted to know
that the 17-year cicada is considered a delicacy and you can find
[**several recipes
online**](http://www.tennessean.com/local/archives/04/03/48362311.shtml?Element_ID=48362311).
