Back from PDC and I'm still unburying from all the work I have.  PDC was
great, but thoroughly exhausting, and I learned to drive way to
aggressively all over downtown LA in a stylish white Pontiac Grand Am,
which Anson Horton (a fellow
[turtle](http://www.feartheturtle.umd.edu/)) described as an angry
vacuum cleaner. 
[MapPoint](http://www.microsoft.com/mappoint/2004/default.mspx) was definitely
my friend.  The best part about these events are the people you meet,
whether they are customers, RDs or MVPs, it was great to hang out and
socialize with these groups as we don't get the opportunity to do that
too much.  

The cat is finally out of the proverbial bag for most of Whidbey/Yukon
and a good chunk of Longhorn, and now developers are finally getting
first hand access to Whidbey bits.  So what's coming down the road? 
We'll you'll probably see several MSDN TV episodes where different
product teams will discuss the changes in their particular area. 

  - Anders Hejlsberg 's Language Enhancements and Scott Wiltamuth/Anson
    Horton's New IDE Features PDC talks will be available on the C\# Dev
    Center "soon".
  - We'll also be publishing a sneak peek at C\# Whidbey document "soon"

In the meantime, you can learn more about the C\# IDE in this [C\# Pro
Magazine
article](http://www.c-sharppro.com/features/2003/12/cs200312ah_f/cs200312ah_f.asp),
or get excited about the C\# ecosystem
