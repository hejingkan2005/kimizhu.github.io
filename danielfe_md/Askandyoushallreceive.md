\[I can't post much right now as our entire team is working their tails
off for events like Envision, [Developer
Days](http://www.microsoft.com/seminar/devdays2004/default.mspx),
and MDC 2004.\]

Lot's of people don't think they can influence a company like Microsoft,
but it's not true, we really do hear what you say, in fact because
[Mikel](http://mjberger.com/) and [Tony](http://www.bostondotnet.org/) 
commented on my [blog
post](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2003/11/12/51868.aspx) that
they were interested in seeing a ClickOnce [MSDN
TV](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/) episode, they
[shall receive](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20040108ClickOnceJC/manifest.xml).

MSDN TV even has an [RSS feed](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/rss.xml)
so you can stay up-to-date on the coolest new episodes covering Whidbey
and Longhorn.

Thank you Erica Weichers for making MSDN TV possible
:)
