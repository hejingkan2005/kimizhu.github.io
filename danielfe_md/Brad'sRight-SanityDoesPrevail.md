Brad Abrams recently penned a blog: [PM Tip \#21: Sanity Will
Prevail](/brada/archive/2006/02/22/536644.aspx). Wow, if there is one
lesson to learn at Microsoft, for your own sanity, it's this one. [John
Montgomery](/johnmont/) actually shared this one a while back and
I honestly didn't believe him at the time. To paraphrase John, "the
right thing will happen, but it may take longer then you expect." A
weird thing happened about two weeks ago. Three (totally unrelated)
initiatives I've been pushing for since 2003 finally got approved. While
it took a lot longer then I would've liked, sanity does in fact prevail,
and it's a beautiful thing :)
