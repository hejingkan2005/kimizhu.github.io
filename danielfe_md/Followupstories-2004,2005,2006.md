**July 2004 -** [**The Seattle Air Conditioning
Lie**](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/07/30/201459.aspx) -
Another summer, another big increase in the number of blog hits for
people searching on "Seattle Air Conditioning". Yes, with high's in the
[80's](http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/USWA0395?from=search_10day),
Seattle is beautiful outdoors, but muggy as hell indoors. There are, of
course, those that continue to perpetuate the myth (you know who you
are, sweating in bed at night, miserable yet too proud to admit that
you're miserable).

Here's a recent comment from that post by "Mike":

This of course leads to our 2005 update...

**December 2005**
[**Coolest.Job.Ever**](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2005/12/16/504859.aspx)** **-
Who knew, blog hiring \*actually\* works. While it does put much more
work on you, the individual blogger to sort and sift through resumes and
schedule follow up interviews and such, the end result is worth it as we
hired Doug Handler, (and his wife Jen into MSN) a couple of months ago. 
As this is Doug's first summer here, he's been coming in every day this
weekend complaining about how uncomfortable it is to try and sleep when
you're sweating and keeping the window for him is even worse as his
neighbors have yappy dogs that don't include mute buttons. 

**June 2006** [**Justice 2.0 - How Not to Steal a
Sidekick**](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2006/06/08/622365.aspx) -
[Evan's tail](http://www.evanwashere.com/StolenSidekick/) of recovering
his friend's Sidekick proves the disbelievers wrong, the 17-year old
gets in handcuffs, and the hope of justice happens against impossible
odds.  The infamous sidekick will even be auctioned on eBay\!
