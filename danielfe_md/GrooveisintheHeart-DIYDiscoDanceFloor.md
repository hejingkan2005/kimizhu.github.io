"Disco Dance Floor")

File this under the coolest use of C\# ever...[Clint
Rutkas](http://www.betterthaneveryone.com/), rock star, built a homemade
LED Disco Dance Floor (as seen on
[Digg](http://digg.com/hardware/Disco_Dance_Floor_Completed)) and
recently he wrote a "how-to" article on
[Coding4Fun](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/coolapplications/disco/default.aspx)\!\!
I seriously want to build one of these for my office in my "free" time
:)

You should definitely check out the collection of [YouTube
videos](http://betterthaneveryone.com/?p=347) and his [party
pictures](http://betterthaneveryone.com/?p=350) to see it in action. 
The article is great and Clint manages to pull off a mix of
[Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) technical pragmatism, and
[Rory-esque humor](http://neopoleon.com/blog/) which makes for an
educational and entertaining read.

PS - I know the formatting needs to be fixed on the code samples
