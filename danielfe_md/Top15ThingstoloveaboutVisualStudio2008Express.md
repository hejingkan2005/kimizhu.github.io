Visual Studio Express 2008 is [now available for
download](http://www.microsoft.com/express)\!\!

 

Our new Web site is <http://www.microsoft.com/express>\!

 

Below are my top 15 things to love about Visual Studio Express

**15. Free hosting for client-based Web sites with Popfly
Explorer**

[![PopflyExplorer](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/PopflyExplorer_thumb.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/PopflyExplorer_2.png)

Using the [Popfly Explorer
Add-On](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=104063), you can now
build and design Web pages using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Silverlight
(even add existing Silverlight gadgets from Popfly) and publish them
live to the Web for free. If you're looking for free ASP.NET hosting,
the good folks at Verio have an offer for [free hosting until
January 2010](http://blogs.msdn.com/publicsector/archive/2007/08/30/how-does-free-asp-net-hosting-until-january-2010-sound.aspx)\!

**14. Available in 9 localized languages and extensible for other
languages (MUI Architecture)**

An often overlooked feature, but Visual Studio Express is available in
English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese Simplified, Chinese
Traditional, Japanese, and Korean. Over the next couple of months, we'll
ship all 9 localized versions of all four Express products (VB, C\#,
C++, VWD). In addition, in 2008, we redesigned the localization engine
to support MUI which will enable our subsidiaries (or even customers) to
localize Express into even more languages.

**13. Multi-targeting or using VS 2008 for .NET Framework 2.0 Projects**

Visual Studio 2008 is the first Visual Studio product that enables you
to target multiple runtimes, so if your Web hosting company or your
business only runs with .NET Framework 2.0, you can select 2.0 as your
target Framework and it will still "just work" and even provide
IntelliSense errors if you try to use something not available in 2.0
like LINQ.

**12. Integrated C++ Platform
SDK**

[![image](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_thumb_1.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_4.png)

One of the key pieces of feedback we got from C++ developers was that it
was difficult to download and configure the Platform SDK (headers,
libraries, and tools) to build native Windows applications. In Visual
C++ Express 2008, we've integrated the Platform SDK directly so this is
much easier than before and with thousands of new native Windows Vista
APIs to play with, C++ developers have plenty of cool applications to
build.

**11. Great Data
Support**

\[Visual Studio Express Database
Designer\]

\[Visual Studio Express LINQ-to-SQL Designer\]

Visual Studio 2008 Express includes a Database Designer (top picture), a
View Designer, LINQ-to-SQL support (bottom picture), drag-and-drop
data-binding for Windows Forms, support for SQL Compact Edition for VB
and C\# Express, as well as new ASP.NET controls for LINQ data sources. 
All Visual Studio Express Editions also enable you to consume data from
Web services as well as support for Windows Communication Foundation
(WCF). Visual Web Developer Express also adding support for \*creating\*
WCF applications.

 

**10. Express Registration
Freebies**

[![image](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_thumb_12.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_26.png)

In conjunction with the Express launch, we're also releasing a ton of
[new samples and resources](http://www.microsoft.com/express/samples/)
including the Coding4Fun Developer Toolkit that adds support for Windows
Vista features including Telephony (bottom picture) Mail, Calendar,
Search, Text-to-Speech, Voice input, audio recording,  and much more in
an easily consumable way for VB and C\# developers.

We're also releasing a new, open source [Windows Vista Peer-to-Peer
chat](http://www.microsoft.com/express/samples/) and video application
(top picture ) that enables you to chat and share pictures and video
with friends anywhere in the world. As part of this application, we have
some drag-and-drop controls to add chat to \*any\* WPF or Windows Forms
application.

**8. Improved Performance**

While not as flashy as a P2P app, the team made significant performance
improvements for things like the Visual Basic background compiler and
C\# IntelliSense on large projects that you'll appreciate as you start
your next project.

**7.  Built-in Support for ASP.NET AJAX and AJAX
Controls**

[![image](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_thumb_6.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_14.png)

[ASP.NET AJAX](http://asp.net/ajax/) now ships in Visual Web Developer
Express 2008 so you can easily do partial-page updates (updates that
dynamically retrieve data from the server without reloading the whole
page) by simply adding an UpdatePanel control. Best of all, you can
reuse all of the [ASP.NET AJAX Control
Toolkit](http://asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/samples/) ([separate
download](http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=AtlasControlToolkit))
to enable some RAD AJAX features including animation, drop shadows,
rounded corners, and more.

**6. Game Development Kit for
C++**

[![image](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_thumb_7.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_16.png)

[![image](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_thumb_8.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_18.png)

Another thing we are announcing today is a partnership with Game
Creators which provides, for free the [C++ Game Developers
Kit](http://www.microsoft.com/express/samples/GameCreators/) (GDK) as
well as the Dark Matter 1 set 2D/3D images and sounds.

 

**5.  Windows Presentation
Foundation**

[![image](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_thumb_10.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_22.png)

New to Visual Basic and Visual C\# 2008 Express Editions is a visual
designer and project templates for building Windows Presentation
Foundation (WPF)applications. WPF applications enable you to build
beautiful, interactive applications that can easily use media, animation
and 2D/3D graphics. Best of all, you can mix and match WPF controls with
Windows Forms applications so you can build animation-heavy pieces of
your application in WPF and add them to your Windows Forms application
or, use data-centric Windows Forms controls like the DataGridView and
add them to your WPF application.

**4. New Web Designer and JavaScript
tool**

[![image](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_thumb_11.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_24.png)

Built on the same engine that powers Expression Web, the Visual Web
Developer Express designer includes a powerful design view with new
features like a Split View to see HTML and the designer, CSS Styles and
Properties Windows to design, preview, and apply styles.

The JavaScript includes improved IntelliSense, type inference, parameter
IntelliSense, support for AJAX controls, improved debugging including
visualizers for JavaScript data, and more.

**3.  Tons of free learning
content**

[![image](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_thumb_13.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_28.png)

With launch, we're also refreshing our Beginner Developer Learning
Center (BDLC) with new videos including Getting Started Videos each of
the four Express Edition products as well as tutorials on LINQ, WPF, and
more. Over the coming months, we'll continue to add more and more
content on Visual Studio 2008 Express.

**2. LINQ and language
enhancements**

[![image](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_thumb_14.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/Top10ThingstoloveaboutVisualStudio2008Ex_C66D/image_30.png)

Visual Studio Express 2008 fully supports Language INtegrated Query
(LINQ) which adds language query capabilities (similar to SQL) directly
into the Visual Basic and C\# languages. What that means is that you can
query databases, XML files like RSS feeds, or in-memory objects all
using a single syntax. Hand-in-hand with LINQ are a number of language
enhancements that simplify working with .NET data types that really
shine when working in tandem with LINQ queries. For more on [LINQ
support in
Express](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2007/08/01/part-1-of-5-what-s-in-visual-studio-express-2008-beta-2.aspx),
see my previous blog post.

**1. It's FREE, you can use it for commercial use\!**

By this point I feel like a Cuisinart salesman, but you get free tools,
free hosting on Popfly for Web pages and Visual Studio Express projects,
free training from the BDLC, free controls and e-Books for registering
Express, and even free samples/resources including the Coding4Fun
Development Kit, the P2P toolkit, and the C++ Game Development Kit.
