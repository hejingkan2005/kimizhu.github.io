I'm giving a talk for TechEd Europe at the end of next week and, while I
have a good idea of what I think I need to talk about, I would love to
get some advice on what you think would make the session really
valuable. 

**Session Title**: *Migrating MSJVM and Other Java-Based Applications to
the .NET Framework  
*<span class="synopsis">**Abstract**: *Attend this session to learn how
to detect and remove dependencies on the MSJVM, including options
available for migrating MSJVM-based applications to the .NET Framework.
This session also reviews tools available for migrating other Java-based
applications to the .NET Framework using Visual J\# .NET and the Java
Language Conversion Assistant.* </span>

<span class="synopsis">**Question**: What information would you want to
walk away with? What information do you need answered from a session
like this?  Are there any specific demos that you would like to see?
