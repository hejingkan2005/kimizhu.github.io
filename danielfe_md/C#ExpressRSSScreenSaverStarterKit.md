**RSS Screen Saver Starter Kit in C\# Express**

One of my favorite features of C\# Express is the built-in RSS Screen
saver Starter Kit.  If you’ve never built a screensaver before, or if
you have never written code that uses RSS, then you’ll find the RSS
Screen saver a great way to start programming.

In a nutshell, the RSS Screen saver is a screen saver that lets you
select and validate an RSS feed, select a background directory for
images to loop through, and the screensaver will loop through the items
in the RSS feed.

The Screen saver displays the list of RSS items and loops through each
one and shows the contents of the feed in the right hand side.  It's got
lots of cool GDI+ transparency features that you can take and use in
your application as well as a simple library to read RSS feeds. If you
have feedback on what features you want added to the screen saver,
submit your suggestions to: the new [MSDN Product Feedback
Center](http://labs.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/Default.aspx).
