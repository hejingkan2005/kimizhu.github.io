Woohoo\! [From
Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/17/porfolio-com-lucasarts-and-bioware-building-kotor-mmo),
Bioware has officially spilled the beans that they are building a MMO
based on the Knights of the Old Republic game. The first KOTOR game was
amazing, clearly one of the best [Xbox games
ever](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/01/13/58115.aspx) and
an amazing twist at the end...in short, a masterpiece.

Hotness\!

 Here are the notes from the Future of MMO's panel in February at GDC
that included [Ray Muyzka from
