If you're one of those people that get songs stuck in your head, don't
follow any of these links :)

I love [Family Guy](http://www.familyguy.com/). Its arguably my favorite
TV show right now and its simply brilliant (The Daily Show with John
Stewart is a very close second). On any given show, you'll find
references to old school TV hits, pop culture icons, and things out of
left field that remind me of the Simpsons around season 2 & 3, but with
a bit more edge. If you're a Family Guy fan, you should definitely visit
[FamilyGuyFiles.com](http://www.familyguyfiles.com) which has a pretty
all-encompassing list of Family Guy references.

One of my favorite references is the reference to the "Peanut Butter
Jelly Time" Internet meme circa 2002. And by favorite I mean I've had
the damn PBJ Time song stuck in my head for weeks continously replaying
in a background thread in my brain until I simply give up and become a
host who's sole purpose is to propagate it unto others like a [ring
virus](http://www.theringworld.com/ringvirus.php).  With that, I hope
that blogging this will finally get this song-virus out of my head :)
