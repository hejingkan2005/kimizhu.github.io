In case you haven't seen this, [Eric
Maino](http://weblogs.asp.net/EMaino/), a lead Student Ambassador,
writes [C\# code to describe his marriage
proposal](http://weblogs.asp.net/EMaino/archive/2004/11/15/257401.aspx).
Sure, I would've used delegates here or an async pattern there, but
all-in-all an amusing read.
