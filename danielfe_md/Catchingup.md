So much to do, so little time...

I was in Miami last weekend for the [**Winter Music
Conference**](http://www.wmcon.com)...lots of fun, beautiful weather,
and of course great music.  [**Deep Dish**](http://www.deepdish.com) had
a great set at [**Club Space**](http://www.clubspace.com) and me and the
Mrs. danced from midnight until 8am in the morning, when my creeking-old
body quickly caught up to me.  The sick part is that we stepped outside
the club covering our eyes from the sunlight like vampires only to
discover that there was still a line to get in.  I guess I'm not as
hardcore as I used to be :)

We also stayed at the [**Pelican Hotel**](http://www.pelicanhotel.com)
which I would definitely recommend.  Every room is uniquely designed and
has its own distinctive name like: Viva Las Vegas, Power Flower, and the
room we stayed in: “Me Tarzan, you Vain“.  You can actually tour each
room online, the penthouses are amazing, but they're a bit more
pricey:)  So why did I like this hotel so much? Easy:

  - High speed wireless internet
  - Cool room design
  - Great location in the heart of South Beach
  - free gifts for guests - we got free promo CDs for being guests
  - Beach chair and umbrella service
  - Blowpops instead of mints on the bed
  - Great high-powered showerhead
  - 3-disc CD player in room
  - Great restaurant and room service

Now I just need to unbury from my huge pile of email...
