Do you have questions, comments or thoughts on how we could improve the
[LINQ Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq)?
Please let us know\! One of the key reasons to announce LINQ so early in
the development cycle is to get feedback on how we can improve the
product. With that goal in mind, we have dedicated LINQ on MSDN:

In addition to the forums, on 9/22, the C\# team is going to be having a
live chat on C\# 3.0. This is a great chance to ask questions and get
answers real-time from the team.
