**Rough notes below**

Â 

Game Balance

\- solo to max level

\- important role in a group, raid, and group PVP

\- Starcraft - Race totally different

\- Better players can win games fast

\- Offense over defense (don't want Starcraft 2 as a Sim City simulator)

\- Creative strategies

\- Every unit has a counter

\- Be fun Game Balance

  - Game Balance: Math vs Fun
  - Math is the foundation
  - Everything should feel overpowered
  - Don't balance the game into mediocrity
  - Must understand nuances
  - Can't balance the game through replays (doesn't show up in
    spreadsheet, pathfinding algorithm)
  - Balance for all skill levels
  - Shamans could buff (bloodlust) became much more overpowered, aoe
    spells needed to be adjusted
  - No super weapons
      - Super weapons are fun (not so fun for the other person)
      - Ex: Ghost, powerful weapon feels super (sees nuke silo), see
        ghost sneak in, nuclear launch detected
  - Use your beta
  - how i approach beta - 3 months get as many balance patches within
    that time, buff it a little more
  - UI affects balance
      - Unlimited selection vs 12 selection
      - Internal battle about
      - army of 100 zerglings, game became easier to play, overpowered?
          - Players didn't understand why they could only select 12
            units
      - Multiple building selection
      - Subgroups
          - Before Warcraft 3, all you would get is intersection of
            abilities (lowest common demoniator)
              - Hero can still cast spells
      - Wow - Click to move - play more like diablo, not the preferred
        way to play
          - Originally got put in a way to auto-face/pathfind to player
            (PVP)
          - In Wow Beta
      - UI Mods
          - has a dark side
          - What mods are out there
              - should we balance game for modders vs non-modders?
              - make the choice to break the mods
              - Mods are bad when they play the game for you (bot)
      - Balance - It Never Ends
          - Change is always bad to players
          - Maintain your game to keep it relevant
          - Still putting out Warcraft balance patches
          - Ban the cheaters -
          - plan patches, but leave time to be reactive
              - Talent reviews for each class
              - at any given moment, a strategy or bug will be uncovered
          - Don't panic
      - Competitive Sports - Football
          - 3-4 Defense, Zone Blitz
          - NFL isn't outawing defenses, enable players to find the
            counter
  - Player Psychology
      - Not always predictable
      - Perception of fairness -
          - Best balance spreadsheet and tester in the world
          - if players don't believe it, it doesn't matter
      - Can't argue in forums with a million people
          - Arguing is not the answer
      - Players hate losing
          - Counterstrike can play 10 games
          - 1/2 hour - 1 hour long game if you lose, not interested
          - Alliance wins 90% of AV, lose AB 90% of the time
              - Make sure losing side still gets something out of it
              - 1 mark of honor and still get honor
      - How do they climb the ladder?
          - Need to decide what your goals are
          - Starcraft 1 ladder - ELO chess system
              - Not necessarily fun to play
              - \#1 player in world doesn't gain anything from playing
                  - No incentive to be \#1 until \#2 passes you
      - Right amount of complexity
          - Starcraft II - 15 units is the right amount, depth to game,
            learn units and strategies, can still easily identify units,
            understand counterstrategy
          - Magic - The Gathering: Hundreds of thousands of options,
            turn based,
      - AV
          - Original vision o fAV was epic, huge battle zone including
            player controlled bases, npc support, quests, and capture
            point
          - av was ment to be fought in several smaller fronts with npc
            assistance in a war of attrition
      - isn't exactly waht happened
          - How we designed map isn't how we made it
          - incentive to get honor is to kill opposing NPC and just
            zerged to win
          - players ride by each other
          - wave emote on horseback
          - players on losing side still get honor
          - knew it was going to be a 30-60 minute match
          - AFKaving - players leeching honor because of insufficient
            incentives to actually play PVP
      - Inspect messages was creepy
          - \[altair\] is inspecting you
          - players felt they were getting stalked, removed the message,
            now everyone loves the feature
          - Rest isn't a penalty it's a bonus - original implementation,
            keep playing you get less experience, instead switch it to a
            bonus
              - Exact same system, now people love it
          - Warcraft 3 "thumbs" - thumbs up/down any map you wanted
              - Then changed it to a veto system to thumbs-down a map as
                players were asking WTF when they thumbs -down
      - Does a unit, gun, weapon, suggest it's function and power
      - Special effects can cause confusion in battle
      - Team differentiation (Warcraft) races, and colors in Warcraft 3
      - Avoid hidden modifiers - do this very selectively
      - Visualization
          - does the art tell you who has more HP or who runs faster -
            art and balance is not aligned
      - MMO - much, much tougher
          - class-based armor sets - make the art of the armor set
            suggest the class - gear and equipment visualize
      - Home Stretch - Maps
          - Random vs pre-made
              - Age of Empires vs Starcraft
              - Player perception will be that map generator screwed me
                in starting point
          - Number of maps - more is not better
              - Starcraft II - 8 maps
              - more maps means players won't world battle field very
                well
              - Black shround vs Fog of war
                  - reveal resources
              - Size does matter
                  - Bigger isn't better - people want to be in the
                    combat right away,
                  - design as small as make sense for \# of players
      - Matchmaking
          - Less buckets is better
          - What type of game play will it be
          - Don't give players too many choices, no one in your
            matchmaking bucket
          - Feedback on system - LFG doesn't give feedback, AV is in
            queue
              - momentum works against you so if matchmaking doesn't
                work, it falls aparat
      - E-sports
          - Decide upfront if you want an E-sport game
          - Replays
          - Spectator mode
  - If a player beats me

**Questions**

  - World of Warcraft not designed to be E-sport game, now
    retro-fitting, I hope one day we can get a spectator mode into it,
    but it's non-trivial
  - Why don't we have stats on server on maps like there is in Warcraft
    3.
      - We consciously don't put up race versus race stats (Orcs vs
        Undead), you put that on the Web and players will jump onto Orcs
      - If we put up there that alliance always wins AV, horde will stop
        playing
      - Can balance stabilize: Starcraft is pretty well balanced, need
      - Warcraft: Cross-server interaction,
          - hardcore stance that we wanted realms to be their own
            communities
          - softening up - battlegroups, matchmaking (arena),
            battlegrounds (queues)
          - cross-server chat a possibility
      - Philosphy on super-weapons - is this for all games or
        subscription games?
          - For PVP, did the other side feel like there was no way they
            could have stopped it
