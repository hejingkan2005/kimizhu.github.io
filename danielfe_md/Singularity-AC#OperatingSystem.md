Check out the [Channel9 Video on the Singularity operating
System](https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=68302). From the
C9 page: *Singularity is a research project focused on the construction
of dependable systems through innovation in the areas of systems,
languages, and tools. We are building a research operating system
prototype (called Singularity), extending programming languages, and
developing new techniques and tools for specifying and verifying program
behavior. Oh, and the operating system is built in C\#.*
