and
[Jay](http://blogs.msdn.com/jaybaz_ms/archive/2004/10/15/242884.aspx)
have blogged about this already, but Edit and Continue support will be
added to Visual C\# 2005\!\!

I really want to echo Jay's comments about the amount of herculean
effort it took to get this into the product. Everyone really worked
their tails off. Well done\!

Why did we add Edit and Continue? Because you [really, really wanted
it](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/viewFeedback.aspx?feedbackid=bbbf7d31-204c-4a93-af08-fb80328fbe86).
We're listening to you and trying to continuously build a better
product. We can't add everything you want, but we'll try our hardest to
make the best product for you.
