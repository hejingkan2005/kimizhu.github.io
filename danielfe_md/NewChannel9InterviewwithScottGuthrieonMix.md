Last night, I caught up with [Scott
Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu) and we talked about the
up-and-coming technology that will be shown at
[Mix](http://www.visitmix.com/). I just posted Part 1 of the video onto
Channel9 where we discuss IIS 7.0 and what it means for developers.

I'll post Part 2 tomorrow, where Scott delves deeper into the technology
for desktop, Web, and RIA development. The other news coming out
today is that [Ray Ozzie is now confirmed to keynote at
Mix](http://www.visitmix.com/blogs/News/423/) too.

Note:  Early bird registration for Mix ends tomorrow, January 31st, so
[register now](http://www.visitmix.com/).
