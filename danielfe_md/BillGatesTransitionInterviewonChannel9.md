In case you haven't heard, this week is BillG's last week as a full-time
Microsoft employee as he transitions to working full-time at his
foundation. Sure, he'll still be the Chairman of the board and there are
some projects that he will work with directly, but it is still a bit
weird to think about Microsoft without Bill Gates.

 

In this [30 minute Channel 9
interview](https://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Charles/Bill-Gates-Transitioning-into-the-Future/)
with Charles Torre, you'll hear Bill talk about his transition, Ray
Ozzie, competing against Google, improving Microsoft's agility, what's
going to be important for our platform in the next decade and of course
Bill's role at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
