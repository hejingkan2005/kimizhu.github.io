Today at Facebook F8, Corporate Vice President Dan'l Lewin announced a
new partnership between Microsoft and Facebook.

 

  - **Popfly Facebook Block**: Available immediately, we've added the
    Facebook block which prodices access to Facebook data including the
    User Profile, Friends, Photos, Photo Albums, and Events.
  - **Leverage Existing Blocks**: You can build Facebook applications
    using Popfly blocks like Flickr, Digg, Soapbox, Twitter, Windows
    Live, Xbox Live, and Virtual Earth.
  - **Silverlight Support**: Another big win here is Facebook has native
    support for Easily build next generation applications using
    Silverlight. With 24 million users and 40 billion page views a
    month, this is a huge, huge win for getting native Silverlight
    support on Facebook
  - **Visual Studio Support**: The [Facebook Developer
    Toolkit](http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/showcase)
    enables developers to build applications for Windows, Web, or
    Microsoft Office.

And here's a view of the results, the images are dynamically retrieved
from a user's
profile.

It's not just Popflyers, any of the 14 million Visual Studio Express
downloaders (and pro Visual Studio customers as well) to build Facebook
applications using the [Facebook Development
Toolkit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91179&clcid=0x409) and
build application ASP.NET, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows
Forms and any
other

Check out the [Showcase
page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/showcase/) for more
information including ASP.NET Quickstarts and video tutorials.

For configuration on Popfly, click the "Needs Key link on the Facebook
block" or select the Video Tutorial and you'll see a Facebook
configuration
block

Big props to Doug Handler and Christopher Griffin on our team, the
adCenter team, the non-pro team, and Dave Morin and the rest of the
Facebook team. Perhaps I'm biased, but this is the biggest developer
partnership from Microsoft I can think of.

 

I'm at the all-night hack-a-thon so I'll be publishing live pictures a
bit later.
