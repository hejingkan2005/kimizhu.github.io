After spending three years here, our team is moving from Building 42 to
Building 17. I really liked Building 42, besides being more modern, the
42 dwellers seem to be much more in-touch. For example, Bldg 42 housed
many well-known bloggers like [Chris
Anderson](http://www.simplegeek.com/),
[Soma](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/), [Scott
Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/), [Don
Box](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/), among others, and I frankly
don't know any Buiding 17 bloggers (give a shout out if you see this).
My only complaint about Building 42 was the damn COM+ lab with whom I've
battled way too many times with contuously-beeping power surge hardware.

 

**Random Stuff in my office  
**Why is you never realize how much ~~junk~~ stuff you have until you
pack it?  Here are some of the gems that I found in my office:

  - A [Bad
    Hair](http://www.amazon.com/Bad-Hair-James-Innes-Smith/dp/1582343292/sr=8-1/qid=1166116768/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7127103-7243165?ie=UTF8&s=books) Book
  - The [Encyclopedia of
    Hell](http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Hell-Miriam-Van-Scott/dp/0312244428/sr=1-1/qid=1166116887/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7127103-7243165?ie=UTF8&s=books)
    - This should be required reading for cube dwellers to properly
    categorize evil co-workers and to know what level of hell you are in
    during a project.
  - A miniature tiki god from Bora Bora
  - An [Initech Mug](http://www.buyinitechmugs.com/)
  - A McDonald's Happy Meal Monster Toy that glows in the dark when you
    pull its arms
  - A Fart Alarm Detector
  - A C\# Shot Glass
