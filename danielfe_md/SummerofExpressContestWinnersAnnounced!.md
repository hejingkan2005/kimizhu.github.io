After some really tough judging, we officially have the Summer of
Express contest winners\! There were some awesome applications in the
C\# category, I was really impressed by the work and level of effort put
in by all the entrants. You can download the projects on [Channel9's
Express Page](https://channel9.msdn.com/express/).

 We definitely want to do this contest again, but we're thinking about
changing things up and wanted to get your feedback on what makes a good
contest. Here's what I've been thinking

  - Get Better prizes - This one requires a good amount of legal work
    far ahead of the contest, but it is doable
  - Have prizes for 1st, 2nd, 3rd for a given category - I wish I
    could've given prizes to the top 5 C\# entries :)
  - Change the categories - Rather then be product focused, I would
    imagine categories like - Best Game, Best productivity tool, Best
    utility, Best use of the network, Best use of SQL Server, Best Web
    app

What do you think makes a good contest?
