I was trading emails with [DJ Bolivia](http://www.djbolivia.ca/) today
and little did I notice that he released another **great** [Music to
Code By](/danielfe/archive/2005/01/10/350120.aspx) release, which will
have a total of six releases. The new release is Vol 4 - "*Partisan
Scream Fest*" (The Power of Blogs). What's the significance of the name,
well DJ Bolivia writes:

> *In the last year or so, the ability of individual bloggers to
> influence and make themselves heard in mainstream media has increased
> exponentially. Is this a good thing? I think so. This mix is made in
> acknowledgement of that influence.

"[Partisan Scream Fest](http://www.djbolivia.ca/bolivia.html#partisan)"
