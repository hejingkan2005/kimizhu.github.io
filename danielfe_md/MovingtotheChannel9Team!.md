This week I officially became the newest member to [Jeff Sandquist's
Channel9 team](http://www.jeffsandquist.com/)\! Here's my
[quick-and-dirty interview on
Channel9](https://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=373859). I'm
really excited to be on the team and yes, I am not afraid to go back to
[Stage 1 -
