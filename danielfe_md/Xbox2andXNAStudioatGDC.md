Xbox 2 will have a multicore processor and be able to perform one
trillion calculations per second. Not only that, you can use [XNA
Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/xna/3.7.2005.aspx), built on [Visual
Studio Team System](http://www.microsoft.com/xna/3.7.2005.aspx) to
develop games. **Sweetness**.

[Quoted from the Microsoft press
release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/mar05/03-09GDC05PR.asp)

*A well-balanced system that will deliver more than a teraflop of

[Quoted from
News.com](http://news.com.com/Microsoft+developer+tools+prep+for+next+Xbox/2100-1043_3-5603082.html)

*XNA Studio is one of the first major products to come out of the XNA
Initiative Microsoft announced a year ago to standardize game
development across different systems. Developers could use the same XNA
tools to create games for Windows PCs, the current Xbox and future
versions of the console, Microsoft promised.*

*XNA Studio is based on Visual Studio Team System, Microsoft's
collection of code-writing tools for Windows developers who work in
large teams.*

*XNA Studio will include similar collaboration features meant to
facilitate the exchange of code between programmers, designers, quality
assurance testers and other members of a development project, Microsoft
said in a statement. The software will also introduce a new unified file
format to ease sharing of game assets.*
