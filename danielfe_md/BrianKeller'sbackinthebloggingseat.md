It looks like [Brian's](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/) blogging again,
and he has some [fascinating
gossip](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/archive/2004/02/12/71977.aspx) on
Barbie and Ken's breakup and the rumor that C\# & J\# are dating.  I'm
sure your asking yourself whether Brian is heavily medicated, and I can
assure you that his medication dosage is in fact not heavy.
