As many of you know, and as I had gotten feedback from other
postings, our developer division is looking to change the way it ships
early releases where before we would have massive betas, 6-9 months
apart, now we will ship interim builds (officially called “community
tech previews“),  and our customers will have early access to code.

**Caveat**: There are no guarantees that Visual Studio/.NET Framework
will be more stable then early versions.  A drag and drop designer may
not work at all, even though it worked fine in the PDC M2 builds.

Now onto the news, the first community tech preview of Visual Studio
2005 will be given out at VSLive this week\!\!

*“...developers eager to see the latest and greatest Whidbey code will
get access to what Microsoft is calling "community technical previews"
of that code later this week at the VSLive show in San Francisco.*

*“The idea behind these previews is to shorten the feedback loop between
developer customers and Microsoft.”*
