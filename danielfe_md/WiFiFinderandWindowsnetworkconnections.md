I got my [WiFi Finder](http://www.kensington.com/html/3720.html) today,
its pretty big for a keychain, but then again, I carry a PocketPC Phone
so I'm used to large tech gadgets.  The WiFi Finder succesfully noticed
that my office has a wireless network, and from reading the
instructions, it can detect both 802.11b and 802.11g networks.  I'll
keep reporting on how well war-walking works, and I'll probably get some
[chalk](http://www.warchalking.org/) too :)

[Goldfarb](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/bgold/) sent out this nice tip for
how you can tell Windows whether you want to use your wireless or LAN
connection for a network:

  - Right click on my network places and select Properties
  - You'll see an explorer window open up, and on the toolbar there is
    an Advanced menu
  - Select Advanced\>\>Advanced Settings...
  - This will open to the Adapters and Bindings tab
  - Simply place these in the order that you want your PC to connect to
    the network (LAN, then wireless, etc)
