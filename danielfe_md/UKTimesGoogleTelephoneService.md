*Google gears up for a free-phone challenge to BT  
By Elizabeth Judge, Telecoms Correspondent  
   
GOOGLE revolutionised the internet. Now it is hoping to do the same with
our phones. **The company behind the US-based internet search engine
looks set to launch a free telephone service that links users via a
broadband internet connection using a headset and home computer.  
**   
The technology that will enable Google to move in on the market has been
around for some time. Software by the London-based company, Skype, has
been downloaded nearly 54 million times around the world but no large
telecommunication firms have properly exploited it.*

*BT, which connects seven out of ten British households, has developed
its own internet-telephone service. However, the telephone giant, which
has the most to lose if the new technology takes off, has been reluctant
to promote it heavily.*

Interesting, what do you all think?
