I have no time, not even for hockey. I've missed two games because of
work and have yet to have a free weekend to heat mold my [Mission Helium
He950
skates](http://2004.missionhockey.com/MissionHockey/ROLLER/Roller2005/pop.html).
These things are so damn light and fast, they ought to compensate for my
complete lack of dedication to working out or playing hockey. Assuming I
can get them to fit right and that's where the heat molding comes in.
Speaking of skating, I want to go [off-road
skating](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/trailskate-023148.php) with the
TrailSkate. This look shweeet.
