*"Our early trial users have given us consistently great reports on
ReSharper because it provides many of the same types of productivity
enhancements in C\# that IntelliJ IDEA provides in Java," said Eugene
Belyaev, president and chief technology officer at JetBrains.Â  "By
expanding the Early Adopter Program beyond our intellij.net online
developer community, we now invite developers worldwide to help us make
ReSharper an unmatched C\# productivity tool in the Visual Studio
environment."*
