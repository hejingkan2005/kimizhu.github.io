Tony Goodhew talks about [Visual Studio
"Orcas"](https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=24709) (the
version after VS 2005) on Channel9. I only wish Tony voice was my inner
voice. Brian Keller and I wish Tony would lend his vocal chords for
everything from Airport flight arrival announcements to cell phone
answering messages.

*"Right, so flight 254 from Houston has arrived at Gate D9. As part of
the 9th circuit court of appeals, I must advise you that your luggage
will be on carousel numbah two."*

*"Right, so Dan isn't hear to take a call, but leave a message, he won't
call you back, but you'll feel bettah"* 

Tony rocks :)
