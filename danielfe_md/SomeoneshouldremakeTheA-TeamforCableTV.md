Crazy Idea

[![A-Team\_logo](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/SomeoneshouldremakeTheATeamforCableTV_C8D1/A-Team_logo_thumb.jpg)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/SomeoneshouldremakeTheATeamforCableTV_C8D1/A-Team_logo_2.jpg)

Cue the background military music and authoritative announcer:

>   
> *Ten years ago / In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by
> a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly
> escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles
> underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as
> soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help,
> and if you can find them, maybe you can hire... The A-Team.*

Apparently I'm not the only one who's thought of this, according to
[Wikipedia's A-Team entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Team) - *"In
2003, in research conducted by web-portal Yahoo\! amongst 1,000
television viewers, "The A-Team" was voted as the one "oldie" television
programme viewers would most like to see revived, beating out other
popular televisions series from the 80s such as The Dukes of Hazzard and
Knight Rider."*

**

The A-Team had a huge following and still has a cult status among many
of the fans who watched the show while growing up. There's no doubt in
my mind that this show would be a hit if it's written well.  

My advice would be to do it, but instead consider a deeper, darker,
modern version, and keep it on cable
([Spike](http://www.spike.com/network/spike), [HBO](http://ww.hbo.com/),
[Showtime](http://www.showtime.com/), [A\&E](http://www.aetv.com/)).

**Modernize the story**

  - Surround the story around Green Beret or Army Ranger veterans from
    Afghanistan, maybe have the back-story be how the A-Team stopped
    atrocities by [Blackwater
    mercenaries](http://www.blackwaterusa.com/) and thus were ousted by
    commanders who had a financial interest in ensuring that Blackwater
    "runs" Afghanistan.
  - Go Darker - People actually die, everyone wears flack jackets, real
    military techniques are used, and go global instead of being
    primarily in the US.

**My Dream Team of
Characters**

**BA Baracus aka Mr. T  
**In some ways, this is the easiest to cast. Mr. T should be played by
none other then backyard brawler turned Internet legend Kimbo Slice. If
you're not familiar with
[Kimbo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimbo_Slice), watch him crush
opponents in his [YouTube
videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kimbo+slice)

**Face  
**There's a couple of different ways I think Face could go.

Face Option \#1 - Owen Wilson - One way would be to be the
trip-over-himself adorableness of Owen Wilson. It's a different take on
Face who was Mr suave, but I think it could work, especially if you see
the option for Murdock from below. Oh and women are crazy about him and
he could play the whole "Hollywood" thing.

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Face</strong><br />

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Face Option \#2 - This may seem like an odd casting, but if you imagine
a deeper/darker version of the A-Team, Skeet has the troubled pretty-boy
thing going on and you could easily see him as a darker, tougher,
seducer. Plus, no one really believes Face as in the army :)

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Murdock**

Murdock Option \#1 - Will Ferrall - Perhaps this is too easy a casting,
but I could certainly imagine Will Ferrall as a mental patient, plus his
chemistry with Owen Wilson as Face would be, as has been proven in Old
School, Wedding Crashers, etc, be hilarious.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Murdock Option \#2 Nick Swardson - Another great option would be Nick
Swardson of Benchwarmers, and Reno 911 fame. Nick's Reno 911 character
shows he can play a compulsive liar which isn't a stretch to play a
mental patient, plus, if you modernize the A-Team, perhaps Murdock would
be homosexual which may be a more believable reason for Mr. T to not
like him, but homophobia by the most masculine character may feel a bit
too formulaic.

Murdock Honorable Mention - Mitch Hedberg - While Mitch passed away due
to a drug overdose, he would have been a perfect Murdock, you can't
understand what he's saying half the time, he's burst funny, and he
looks like he could have served as a helicopter pilot and gone crazy as
a result.  If you're not familiar with [Mitch
Hedberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Hedberg), do yourself a
favor and [buy his CDs](http://www.mitchhedberg.net/cd.html), you'll
thank me later.

**Hannibal**

Hannibal Option \#1 - William Hannibal Macy - Okay, his middle name
isn't Hannibal, but he could certainly play the part.

Hannibal Option \#2 - Lawrence Fishburne - He can certainly play the
part of a lead of ex-Military-gone mercenaries, he's got that older
charisma, and he's got that bit-of-cool that Hannibal exuded, I could
see him laughing with sunglasses whilst smoking a cigar.
