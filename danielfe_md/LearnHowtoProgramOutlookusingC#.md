Andrew Troelsen wrote a great article on creating an [Outlook add-in
using
C\#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/ol03csharp.asp). 
Having had to struggle to create my first C\# Outlook add-in, I realized
how difficult it was to create and that there was little information on
MSDN.  You should definitely check it out, the article includes a 
Console version of Pine,
“OPine”.

Not only that, it also includes an Outlook COM add-in written in C\#.
The add-in displays rollup statistics that shows you how many emails
you've sent and received over a day and month. It's a great way to track
how far behind you
are...

In my (non-existant) free time I want to add some more statistics to the
COM add-in:

  - Sent/Received Ratio
  - Avg Time to Respond to an email message
  - Avg amount of scheduled and non-scheduled time in your calendar
    (ex: 3 hours of non-scheduled time/day)
  - Hook it up to an XML Web service so that you can record your “busy”
    score 

If you have other good ideas for C\# articles that you can't find good
information on, let me know.
