I'll be in New Zealand next week for
[TechEd](http://www.microsoft.com/nz/teched/default.aspx) and I'm pretty
siked.  I'm delivering three sessions for those interested:

1.  C\# Past, Present, and Future
2.  Building Middle Tier applications with C\#
3.  C\# Best Practices

If you're attending, please stop by and say "hi".  Hopefully I won't
have to [compete with DataGrid
Girl](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/briankel/PermaLink.aspx/22ca8408-856a-48e4-83f3-2df09b28d660) like
Brian did :)

Also, if you have any recommendations for must see places in Auckland, 
please let me know.
