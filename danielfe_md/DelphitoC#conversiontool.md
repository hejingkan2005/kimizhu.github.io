*“Delphi2CS is an assistant tool that converts Delphi code to C\#.
 Delphi2CS creates a new project, converts each file from the original
project(.dpr) into the new project(.csproj), and generates a report
detailing what was done. After your project is converted, Delphi2CS
inserts comments into your C\# code alerting you to statement that will
need to be changed.”*
