Kudos to the Popfly team for adding new features in their July update.
My favorite features are the pre-loading of assets which will pre-load
images, audio, video before a game starts so it doesn't lag out and the
**High Score** service. The full list of features can be found on the
[Popfly Team
blog.](http://popflyteam.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!51018025071FD37F!297.entry)

 

**Crayon Cannon**

If you haven't played this game, stop what you're doing and give it a
try. It reminds me of [Crayon Physics
Deluxe](http://www.crayonphysicsdeluxe.com/) in its simplicity and
addictiveness.
