![](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/art/csharp_team.gif) As some of
you may already know, Andy, the original C\# mascot, has been retired.
For most of you, especially those members of the C\# team, this may come
as a relief and a day that was long overdue.  For others this news is
both tragic and shocking.

The good news is that Andy has decided to retire to sunnier pastures in
Mascot Hills, Florida where he will spend his time playing shuffleboard
with Spuds Mackenzie, Morris the Cat, McGruff the crime-fighting dog and
other mascots that want to live the good
life.

Thanks for everything Andy, we'll be thinking of you...
