I'm actually surprised that this didn't make more noise, but we
officially launched a [Visual Studio Servicing Web
site](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/support/servicing/default.aspx)
that includes timeframes for when the Developer Division will release
Visual Studio service packs.

Snipped from the site:

  - *Visual Studio 2003 Service Pack 1 ships Q2, 2006*
  - *Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 ships Q3, 2006*
