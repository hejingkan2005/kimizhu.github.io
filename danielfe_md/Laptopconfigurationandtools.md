Last Friday, I received my new laptop, a Toshiba M2, with a Centrino
chip, 1.6GHz, 1GB RAM, DVD/CD-R, an 80GB laptop and the best feature by
far, the 64MB nVidia video card.  My last laptop, a Toshiba Tecra 9100
had serious hardware issues. I had to replace two screens, had a broken
fan and had lots of “unknown” driver issues.  The driver issues were so
bad that I would blue screen (or randomly restart) on average every five
days.  I have to give serious credit to the people who designed Windows
Error Reporting. Why? Well, frankly I would have blamed Microsoft for my
blue screens, but they turned out to be all hardware related.  Anyways,
here's some helpful tools and tips for configuring your new machine.

  - Imaging: [Acronis
    TrueImage](http://www.acronis.com/products/trueimage/) - This
    software is great, \*very\* easy to use, you don't need to restart
    to use it, and you can even create an image on your image. I love
    this software...it makes the tedious process of backing up your
    machine completely painless.
  - Email/File Searching: [X1](http://www.x1.com) - simple and sweet
  - Organizing Links: [OnFolio](www.onfolio.com)
  - RSS Reader: [Newsgator](http://www.newsgator.com) -
    [SharpReader](http://www.sharpreader.com) is great, but you can't
    beat Outlook integration
  - Network Utilities: [NetStumbler](http://www.netstumbler.com)
  - Virtualization software: [Virtual
    PC 2004](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/virtualpc/)
  - Image Editing: [Digital Image
    Pro](http://www.microsoft.com/products/imaging/products/tour.asp#) -
    Lots of great built in features to do cool things like smart-erase,
    blemish removal, and lots more. Take the product tour and enjoy

**Laptop Best Practices**

  - Buy a second hard drive (40GB) and a drive bay that you can swap out
    in your DVD drive bay. Copy all of your VPCs on the second hard
    drive and you'll notice dramatic perf improvements since the OS can
    spin on its own drive. You should also use differencing images so
    that you have one base image and multiple unique builds on top of
    those images. If you need more VPC tips, send a comment to [Brian
    Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/), who happens to know more
    about VPCs then anyone I know.
  - If you travel a lot, or your laptop battery is subpar, you should
    definitely get an extra battery add on.  I bought the [nCharge
    VNC-130 system](http://store.yahoo.com/1800mobiles/ncharge.html) and
    have been really happy with it. I get about 6 \*additional\*
    hours using the nCharge with my old, highly draining Tecra 9100.  I
    like the nCharge system because it can be used with any type of
    laptop (assuming you have an adapter) and it can, with the proper
    adapter, power anything with a car adapter like a cell phone, Pocket
    PC, etc
  - If you're running Windows XP, turn on ClearType. right click on your
    desktop and select properties, select appearance, click Effects, and
    change the “Use the following method to smooth edges of screen
    fonts” and select ClearType. You can configure [ClearType
    here](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/1.htm?fname=%20&fsize=).
  - If you have a large hard drive (\>30 GB), change the default recycle
    bin size from 10% (the default) to 1%.

That's all I can think of now, did I miss something? Are these valuable
tips? Let me know
