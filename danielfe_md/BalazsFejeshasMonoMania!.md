Check out [Balazs's post on using Mono for
Fun](http://fb2.hu/x10/Articles/MonoForFun.html). He walks through
creating a client GUI end-to-end using Mono including designing the
architecture, using [db4objects](http://www.db4o.com/community/)
for persistence, and [nUnit](http://www.nunit.org) for unit tests. Good
stuff.

*How I Went Mono  
In the last 5-6 years I've been working on the Java/J2EE platform,
delivering enterprise applications for various customers. By
"enterprise" I mean applications which have to accomodate a large number
of concurrent users, have to integrate with various legacy back-end
services, have to fit an end-to-end architecture envisioned by the
customer, and has to be manageable and configurable in a consistent,
straight-forward way. I have found Java and J2EE the perfect platform
for this. While there has been a bit of a backlash against the perceived
complexity of the various frameworks associated with J2EE, I think the
enterprise space with its inherent constraints is really an area which
benefited the most from the pluggable, scalable, and manageable aspects
of the Java stack.
