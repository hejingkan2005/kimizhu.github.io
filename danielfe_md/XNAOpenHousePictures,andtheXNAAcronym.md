As Major Nelson mentioned in his [blog
post](http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2006/12/11/xna-game-launcher.aspx),
XNA had an open house on Monday night at the Xbox campus. Here's a
[video of the launch
event](http://www.xbox.com/NR/rdonlyres/6D12AECB-A17B-4012-8F29-35AF5C521D4C/0/vidXNA_Community_PartyHi.asx)
including Major Nelson interviewing [Dave
Weller](http://www.letskilldave.com).  

Unfortunately I only had my camera phone, so the pictures aren't great,
but here's an XNA game running on the
Xbox

Here's a blurry picture of Channel9's Rory Blyth doing a video
interview

Big props to Dave for getting the event organized on such short notice.
As you may have seen, the [XNA announcement was on the front page of
Slashdot](http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/06/12/11/2346244.shtml).

 

Here's an amusing
[comment](http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=211238&cid=17203860)
on the XNA acronym from the Slashdot post:

> From the FAQ:  
> **Q: What does XNA stand for?**  
> A: XNA's Not Acronymed
> 
>   
> *Seems even the Evil Empire has a sense of humour.*

For those who don't know, you can thank (or blame) Dave, not J Allard,
for that :)
