Jeff Sandquist [is looking for potential Microsoft
employees](http://www.jeffsandquist.com/MicrosoftEmployeesShowUsYourHome.aspx)
who wouldn't mind showing how they've pimped their house with technology
like X10, Windows Media Center, Windows Home Server, and more.

This is an awesome idea and it rocks that Jeff and team are doing this.
Amusingly, I dug up an old email from June, 2004 with Jeff and I talking
about doing this, but he wouldn't be able to until July because he was
slammed. wanted to get [Jay Bazuzi](http://blogs.msdn.com/jaybaz) to do
this given that before Windows Home Server, he had a crazy home network
with multiple domain controllers.

 

So, besides Bill Gates' house (which has its own [Wikipedia
article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates%27_house)), who's
*Geek-Crib* would you want to see? These are in no particular order

  - **[J
    Allard](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/jallard/default.mspx)**
    - I bet he has a really, really nice home theater system
  - **[Eric Gunnerson](http://blogs.msn.com/ericgu)** - I'd save this
    for the holidays for when Eric has his lights up. Eric also had
    hacked his Pocket PC into a remote control
  - **Craig Symonds** - [Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel)
    had tried to get Craig to let us tape his house as he has a home
    automation hookup, but I don't think it ever happened
  - **[Jay Bazuzi](http://blogs.msdn.com/jaybaz)** - Jay's always
    tinkering with cool stuff and is one of the go-to folks for Windows
    Home Server.
  - **[Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/)** - Well, because
    he's Scott :)
  - **[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/)** - Back in
    2004, Scott and I talked about a [similar
    idea](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b833aaa4-6270-4ddd-9752-4b5fbdccb62e)
    about doing a "Tech Eye for the Regular Guy" where we give you a
    total *Geek makeover* with Media Center, Xbox, Home Theater, you
    name it. Scott's apparently got a killer setup now too, can't wait
    to see that video
  - **[Clint Rutkas](http://www.betterthaneveryone.com/)** - Is there
    any doubt the guy that could turn his apartment into a [Disco Dance
    Floor](http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2006/11/01/918683.aspx)
    wouldn't have a bad-ass pad? Well Clint did recently move so maybe
    in a few months :)

 

**Non-Microsoft Folks Cribs**

  - [**Brian Peek**](http://www.brianpeek.com) - If his house has even
    some of the cool stuff he's written about on Coding4Fun, then this
    should be a fun demo
  - [**Phil Torrone**](http://makezine.com/blog/) - Phil's always
    working on fun, cool projects on Make and of course [art
    work](http://www.artofoffice.com/PowerPoint/Illegal-Prime) that
    would make for an interesting tour
  - **[Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/)** - If his crib
    is anywhere near as cool as his
    [PC-making](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000905.html)
    skills, this would definitely be an interesting video  

> #### "Who's crib do you want to see?"

PS - I still think we should do Tech Eye for the Regular Guy - Send
Scott, Clint, Brian

of our '04 conversation cracked me up: *Right to Left: Bill Evjen
(Reuters and countless books, including one on WSE and ASP.NET 2.0
Beta), Ari Bixhorn, the Adam Sandler of Group Program Management, and
Dan Fernandez.  **One day we will all co-host Saturday Night Live
together.***
