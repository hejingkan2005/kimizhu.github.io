We are holding our C\# SDR meetings this week in Redmond with some of
our best customers who come from a wide variety of backgrounds. The
discussion is great and the feedback we're getting will help us build
better products that help solve real-world customer problems.

blogged about this yesterday, but in reading his post, I realized I'm
not sure what SDR stands for.  I always thought that SDR stood for
***Strategic*** Design Review, not ***Software*** Design Review.
[Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/)'s only definition for SDR is a
type of RAM memory, [Whatis.com](http://www.whatis.com) points to
Software-Defined Radio and
[AcronymSearch](http://www.acronymsearch.com/) finds five matches with
the closest one being ***System*** Design Review.

If you know the right answer, let me know :)
