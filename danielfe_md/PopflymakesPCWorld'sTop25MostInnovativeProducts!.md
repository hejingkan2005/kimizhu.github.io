I'm late on this, but **BIG** kudos to the Popfly team for having the
sole Microsoft entry in [PC World's Top 25 Most Innovative
products](http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,140663/article.html)\!

 Here's a snippet from the article:

> * **Microsoft Popfly***
> 
> *Innovation: Lets you use* [*Microsoft's
> Silverlight*](http://www.pcworld.com/tags/Microsoft+Silverlight.html)
> *platform to create Web mashups.*
> 
> *Benefit: Though Popfly is still in early beta, its operation is
> clearer and its display is more attractive than that of the similar*
> [*Yahoo*](http://www.pcworld.com/tags/Yahoo!+Inc..html) *Pipes tool.*
> 
> *If you ever played with Legos as a kid, then you should be able to
> assemble a Web mashup in* [*Microsoft's
> Popfly*](http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,138636/article.html)*. No
> coding know-how needed--using Popfly is as simple as choosing content
> sources (such as pictures, video, or news feeds from various online
> sources) and connecting them to a display model (such as a video
> player, a dynamic box for text, or a game of whack-a-mole that pops up
> pictures, for instance). Voilà, you have your mashup. You can embed
> the resulting creation in a blog entry or Web page, or just share its
> URL so others can admire your work.*
