Format: Panel and audience questions

MMO: Can an MMO be successful without 3rd party IP

  - JE - Publisher/investors love IP as it has a guaranteed market, high
    cost needs a guaranteed return
  - RM - Invest enough into marketing and it will cost the same amount,
    need to understand what license enables and what fans want
      - Bioware does both
  - MK - Generally don't use, like a racing MMO doesn't need
  - RP - Pros/cons of approach - benefit, but challenge of working with
    license holder, for them, already using well-known IP and no license
    issues as they owned the IP. Working with an IP will help, no need
    to ask who an Orc is really if it already exists

 

**MMO: Console development?**

  - JE - Champions online will be a MMO for consoles, ridiculous,
    discourage everyone from doing it, especially Blizzard. Has Blizzard
    bought "Africa" yet?
  - RM - Pick and choose your battles, who are you selling it to? It can
    be successful on any platform
  - MK - Mass market, PC is the way to go, experimenting with Xbox 360
    game, can you distribute client for free?
  - RP - Of course there will be, first decision is the game we want to
    make, then decide platform.

**Payment mechanism: Subscription/Microtransactions**

  - JE - Micropayments are crap, I like paying one fee and not worrying
    about it, if i hear one more time, it's not item-based with
    micro-transactions, it's not the wave of the future, I like it as a
    player and as a developer.
  - Matt - investors like subscription-based games, revenue and churn is
    more predictable, microtransactions are less predictable
  - RM - I'd like to ask Jack how he "really" feels. I think it comes
    down to the design of your game, understand what you're making, what
    drives it, why are people going to tell friends about it, not a push
    it's a pull from fans, dominant form in Asia. Individual game and
    the design. Some games you don't want, or make them vanity-based.
    Start with something briliant, then go from there
  - MK - Bigger than NCSoft, if you're going to go for core market that
    would pay subscription, targeting the mass market user, that is the
    main point, kids these days can't afford, undercharge some ($0),
    overcharge others ($100).
  - RP - In asia, biz model is successful, getting Wow successful in
    Asia was more challenging and didn't want to change.
    Microtransactions are not a magic bullet. Make a great game, then
    decide what is the right model. Charge people for server transfers
    and name changes, can merge or do hybrid models, experiment in
    different places. Pay for time version.
      - JE - Wow shows that it is mass market and it's not an east/west
        thing
      - MK - Maple story, Target loves us because on a monthly basis
        they buy cards
      - JE - Microtransactions are not the magic bullet, Target loves
        Wow more
      - RM - both models are possible
      - Matt - buy costumes, custom emotes, can differentiate, if I'm
        enjoying the game, I'm happy to give them more money
      - MK - Sell social experiences that are sticky, average player
        plays 40 hours/month

**Cost is increasing for MMO**

  - JE - Will have high budget and low budgets, measuring themselves
    against Wow. If we can't have Wow, we're not going to even try, more
    than a few companies thinking they can get 1/2 of Wow's numbers.
    $20MM is small in a MMO.
  - Matt - Need to do 1MM subscribers/month, but small MMOs can survive
    with just 50K subscribers
  - RM - Look at it in different ways. Barrier to entry, $100M is
    normal,
  - MK - large budget MMO, won't be a sustainable business for everyone,
    no teams over 100 people, kart rider has \<20 people
  - RP - Wow set the bar to high, great to hear as a publisher, but want
    to see what people will do and how they push it.
      - Everquest was previous 800lb gorilla, factoring in EQ expansions
        (3), so calculate things like land mass, creatures, etc
      - I think Spore could have been redesigned to be a MMO, could be
        very successful and big budget but wouldn't need a content-team
        army

**Q\&A**

  - Can Sci-fi succeed as a MMO genre? Significant hurdles, specifically
    licensed IP doesn't work (a ding against SWG?)
      - What am I going to do in a Sci-fi game?
      - Matt - Single player games that could be expanded into MMO like
        Mass Effect
      - Ray - No comment on Mass Effect as the MMO, commented that
        multiple types are
      - MK - I love Starcraft, if I had a Starcraft MMO i'd play that
        over Wow
      - RP - question is silly, movies is the same way (scifi for 70's
        movie Star Wars), fantasy movies won't work, LOTR shows it can
  - Future of User generated content/addons
      - Matt - UGC - Players can make good stuff, will be in the future
      - Ray - Will Wright giving a talk, pyramid of needs, creators,
        players, etc. Neverwinter Nights - enable people to play will
        never work, wasn't an addon, it was the product. If you launch
        with it and is part of the essence, then there's great
        potential. Tacking it on is a challenge
  - What does the future of MMOs have to do with everything else?
      - Answer: 42
      - Players will never want to play an MMO,
      - TV: Another season of your favorite show,
      - Movie: Regular box games
  - 2007 had lots of - delays, disasters, is industry healthy?
      - JE - Industry isn't healthy, lots of companies have gone busts,
        publisher fear against Wow
          - LOTR is only game for MMO that broke 100K
          - What do you do to make it healthy?
              - Build a really good game?
              - underestimate the effort
      - RM - Ambition and humility, strive to make something brilliant
      - MK - Hard to pull Rob's base customers, Maplestory is successful
        because it hits others
  - Wow - High level of competition is great:
      - Are unofficial vendors problematic?
          - Gold selling market
              - RP - Very aggressive stance against this, you come into
                Wow and you're even, that's a choice/promise we made.
                Persue it as much as possible, depends on games.
  - JE - tells, invites, for spammers in game, so players aren't annoyed
