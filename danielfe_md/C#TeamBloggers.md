[Julian Bucknall](http://www.boyet.com/) (no RSS) a Program Manager on
the C\# team and [Gus Perez](http://www.jixal.com/blog/)
([subscribe](http://www.jixal.com/blog/index.rdf)), a lead on the C\# QA
team, have blogs\!\!

Lot's of interesting stuff here, Julian's got some great algorithms for
Delphi (which I'm sure will all have C\# equivalents soon) and Gus has
an interesting set of books he's reading, cool downloads, and musical
talent.  Subscribed.

I recently got some slack from Shaykat on our team for not having enough
code on my blog.  He's right, but I also don't have free time.  I have a
couple of apps in my task list that I probably need to get around to
doing.  I'll make sure to post the code.
