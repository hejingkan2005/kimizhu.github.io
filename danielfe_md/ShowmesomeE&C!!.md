There's been a lot of discussion on C\# Edit and Continue, and I thought
I would try and share some resources we've put on MSDN.

  - **Tool**: You can try E\&C yourself by using the [Visual C\# 2005
    Express Edition October Community Tech Preview
    (CTP)](http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/5/e/a5efa6aa-b73c-4fa7-89b7-4a5fcd60f2a8/vcssetup.exe) -
    You'll have to follow the workaround described in the [C\# Express
    section of the
    readme](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/readme/cptreadme1004/default.aspx) for
    Windows Forms, and I highly recommend installing the CTP on a
    Virtual PC
  - **Article**: Read more about [C\# Edit and
    Continue](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/edit_continue.asp)
    in this article by [3 Leaf](http://www.3leaf.com/)
  - **Demo Video**: Watch me [demo C\# Edit and
    Continue](http://www.microsoft.com/seminar/shared/asp/view.asp?url=/seminar/en/csharpexpresscpt/manifest.xml&rate=1)

The good people at MSDN have just uploaded the video where I walk
through using Edit and Continue in C\#.

\[Aside: I first got to demo C\# E\&C the day after [I fractured my
arm](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/09/09/227514.aspx) on
two hours sleep. It's a crowd pleaser, especially one handed\]

*Back to being buried....*
