Very cool stuff via [Mike Swanson's blog
post](http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson/archive/2005/10/03/476702.aspx) -
**250 hours of content from 200 sessions** online available for all. The
only question his post \*doesn't\* answer is when it'll be made
available.

*So, how do you get all this goodness? That's the best answer of all. If
you attended PDC05, it'll be automatically shipped to you when it
becomes available (targeting early November). If you'd like to order
your own full DVD set to keep handy,* [*visit the order
page*](http://shop.ecompanystore.com/mseventdvd/MSD_productdetail.asp?EventID=5&TYPE=PDC05)*.
Or...drum roll please...we'll be hosting <span class="underline">all of
this</span>, <span class="underline">for free</span>,
<span class="underline">for anyone</span>, <span class="underline">for
six full months</span>\! Now that's awesome.*
