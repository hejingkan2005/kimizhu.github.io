Sara Williams rocks, but that's beside the point...My blog is now
available at <http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/> and at the weblogs home. 
You'll see just about everyone else recovering from the Gotdotnet
diaspora now links on <http://blogs.msdn.com/> so don't be surprised if
you're making lots of changes to your OPML soon.

I'll be posting more soon, I've just been way too busy :(
