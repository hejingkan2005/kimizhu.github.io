I got back from TechEd New Zealand on Thursday and I'm still catching up
on all my emails, and blogging is always Pri 2 so I'm taking the time
out to catch up on blogging too.  The city of sails was great although
with three sessions I didn't have enough time to fully enjoy it.  I did
get to meet and hang out with [DataGrid
Girl](http://www.datagridgirl.com/) (who's on [.NET
Rocks](http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks.asp#thisweek) this week),
[Tim](http://www.microsoftregionaldirectors.com/Public/..%5Cextranet%5CDirectorDetails.aspx?did=1069),
[Matty](http://teched.net.nz/Lists/Speakers/DispForm.aspx?ID=8), and of
course [Bix](http://teched.net.nz/Lists/Speakers/DispForm.aspx?ID=11). 
Bix started things off at the speaker dinner by performing Louis
Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" in only the way [he
can](http://www.svoboda.co.nz/oxygen/content/teched2003/techspeakersevening07.jpg). 
After that, I didn't have much time to play as I had to prepare
for three talks.  The attendee party was on the night before the
last day of TechEd and we all went and had a good time playing [human
foosball](http://www.totalrebound.com/images/gamepix/Human_Foosball.jpeg),
racing toilets (I went undefeated), riding pigs, having Matty beat me up
in DOA and Tao Feng and much, much more.

I'll be posting answers to some of the questions I received during my
talks and links to resources that I mentioned as well.

Big thanks to Pip, Paul, and Auckland for great hospitality.  It's been
a fun ride, but now I have to unbury my email...
