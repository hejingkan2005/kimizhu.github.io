Last week, at [Digital Life](http://www.digitallife.com/), we announced
**two new partnerships** which expand the reach of hobbyist and
enthusiast developers even further than before.

**  
Intermatic and ControlThink Partnership  
**Microsoft has  partnered with [Intermatic](http://www.intermatic.com/)
to better enable DIY developers to create custom home automation
projects using Intermatics HomeSettings Kit. The goal here is
to provide the hardware, API, and tools to make home automation
easy. In fact, the HomeSettings kit even includes Visual Studio and SQL
Server Express in the box :)

Here's a blown-up picture of the **Home Settings Kit:**

Here's a close up of Visual Basic Express code to turn lights on and
off:

To turn on your lights is as easy as calling:
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Courier New&#39;">Device.Level
= 99 (for max light)</span>

The gear will cost \~$149 (US) and will be in home improvement and
electronics stores like [Lowes](http://www.lowes.com/), and [Frys
Electronics](http://www.frys.com/) very.soon.now.  The next time you go
to do some home improvement, you can pick up a copy of Visual Studio
Express :)

While US and Canada will be available very.soon.now, I believe they are
also working towards WW versions of their gear as well.

Rebate for Registering Visual Studio Express - As a  special bonus,
there is also a link to get a rebate on your hardware if you register
your copy of Visual Studio Express.

 

**Flight Simulator X Partnership**  
The [Hobbyist Renaissance at
Microsoft](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2006/08/10/694715.aspx)
continues, this time with the [Flight Simulator X
SDK](http://fsinsider.com/Community/Developers-Corner/About-the-SDK.htm) which
is included in Flight Simulator X - Deluxe Edition (and only in the
Deluxe edition). The Flight Simulator team has been hard at work for the
last three years ensuring they have a platform that Flight Sim community
can take and build applications upon. The API is available both natively
with C++ and, using SimConnect, a new API, is also available through
Visual Basic, Visual C\#, and any other managed code language. Flight
Simulator's extensibility enables you to control everything from flying
a [pterodactyl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterodactyl) instead of a
plane, to creating custom missions, to automating the environment or
just controlling the weather.

Order [Flight Simulator
X](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-Deluxe-DVD/dp/B000GCJ6MK/ref=sr_11_1/102-8121658-8492911?ie=UTF8) today
as it just went on sale on Monday. This game is beautiful on Windows
Vista

 

**Coming Soon  
**We'll be publishing samples on
[Coding4Fun](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/) on programming both
the Intermatic Home Automation gear and Flight Simulator X as well as a
soon-to-be-uploaded [Channel9](https://channel9.msdn.com/) video of a
"demo home" using home automation gear.
