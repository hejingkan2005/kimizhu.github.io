**Hello World**. If there's a better opening sentence for a technical
blog, I simply don't know what it would be, and I certaintly don't want
my first blog to be entered into a [contest about
cliches](http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/).  Let me quickly introduce
myself, my name is Dan Fernandez and I'm the Product Manager for Visual
C\# .NET, the coolest product at Microsoft (okay, besides Xbox).  Since
so many of us are overwhelmed with resources, I thought I would make
this a simple place to see what things \***I**\* think are valuable, and
hopefully you'll share your cool resources too.

Thanks,

\-Dan

PS - Congrats Rueben\!
