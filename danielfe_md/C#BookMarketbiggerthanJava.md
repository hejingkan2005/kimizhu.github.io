<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">*As you
can see, the gains of C\#, mentioned above, are even more striking than
on the primary category treemap. While **Java is off 10%, C\# is up
78%**. And that's without counting books whose programming language
shows up as ".Net Languages." These are books that cover both C\# and
VB.Net. Combining these two categories, the **C\# book market is now
actually a bit larger than the Java** book market.*

**<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;">*ASP.Net
is also on a roll, with book sales up 61% and JavaScript is up 171%
because of
AJAX.*</span>**
