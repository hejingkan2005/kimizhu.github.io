      - Pacifist - 60 seconds of living
      - Drives different behavior

<!-- end list -->

  - Tetris Splash
      - Every unlocked achievement adds new fish to your fish tank

Small Arms

Buzz around non-descript achievement

  - You had to play against someone who had the achievement
  - Then play against someone who has the achievement

Indirectly played against someone that has the achievement (2 devs had
it and achievement spread from there)

  - Braid
      - Coming out soon
      - 65 levels
      - Uses time as part of the game mechanic
          - Parallel time stream, distort time, reverse time
    <!-- end list -->
      - Meta story - find the meaning of life
          - Similar to bioshock
    <!-- end list -->
      - Ikaruga
          - Polarity - Black or white
              - Black kills white
              - White kills black
              - White ship shooting white actually helps you
    <!-- end list -->
      - Schitzoid -
          - Co-op - only black can kill black, only white can kill white
    <!-- end list -->
      - Every Extend Extra Extreme (E4)
          - Allows you to integrate your music into the game, not
            allowed to integrate your music into rhythm game, (ex: can't
            do guitar hero with your music)
              - Rip music off your DVD - E4 will figure out rhythm and
                analyze the music automatically
    <!-- end list -->
      - Texas Hold 'Em - Statistics
          - Analyze win/loss, flop, turn, bankroll, hands you've

      - Double Dragon (retro games)
          - Extras section - read storyline, original artwork, hints and
            trips
    <!-- end list -->
      - Take away
          - Innovation is really important to us
          - Innovate in any direction
          - Push the envelope
    <!-- end list -->
      - Questions
          - Statistics - Do we have stats on how many games are selling?
              - Do publish under NDA to show games by genre for
                publishers
        <!-- end list -->
          - Is mature content allowed (up to M)
              - Doom is M
              - ESRB regulates
        <!-- end list -->
          - How long should a full version of an arcade game be?
              - JewelQuest has high replay value, depends on game
        <!-- end list -->
          - Do people purchase directly w/o trial?
              - Can't track right now
        <!-- end list -->
          - Examples of games that are not best practices
              - Don't want to highlight games that are "worst"
                practices, not fair to publisher
        <!-- end list -->
          - How long is good for a trial?
              - Frogger - say first level
              - Other games need longer
              - Publishers should sit down and think through what the
                trial experience would be, don't make it an afterthought
