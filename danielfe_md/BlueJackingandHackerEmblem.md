Bluetooth is the *other* 802.11 spectrum technology, which *VerySoonNow*
will be \*the\* way for PAN (Personal Area Networks) communication. It's
also apparently being used in cell phones and being hijacked by script
kiddies to send unsolicited messages to bluetooth-enabled cell phone
users. The idea is simple, use the built-in bluetooth function to send
contacts to users, but use it to send messages to anyone around you. My
fear is that spammers would soon jump on the bandwagon....More

There's also apparently a movement to start an official hacker emblem
based on the glider pattern from the game of life (shown below).
