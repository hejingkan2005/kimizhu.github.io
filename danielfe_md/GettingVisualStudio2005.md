[Soma just broke the
news](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2005/10/27/485665.aspx) so
we can now all talk about it, Visual Studio 2005 has officially RTM'd\!

So how can you get the product?

  - **Subscriber Downloads**:  If you're an MSDN Subscriber, [login and
    start downloading](http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/) the RTM
    version of Visual Studio Team Suite today. This has to be one of the
    best benefits of being a subscriber...early access to bits :)
  - **Physical "box" Products:** Manufacturing can take approximately
    6-8 weeks (or more) to get the product complete and into the channel
    (resellers, Amazon, etc).
  - **Download Express**: The downloadable versions of Visual Studio
    Express will be made available on November 7th 2005.
  - **Localized Products**: The localization teams are working hard on
    getting localized versions of Visual Studio out over the next coming
    weeks and months. Visual Studio is localized into Chinese
    Traditional, Chinese Simplified, English, French, German, Italian,
    Japanese, Korean, and Spanish.

**Updating MSDN for Launch** - You may notice that
<http://msdn.microsoft.com> isn't fully updated for the RTM product. The
site content is being revamped for launch and will go live on the
official launch date, November 7th 2005.
