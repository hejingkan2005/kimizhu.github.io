While this post was originally written in 2009, it still gets a ton of
hits\!

Today, we have lots of new offerings for developers looking for free
tools including Visual Studio Community Edition and updated Visual
Studio Express Editions. I've updated the page with relevant links below

  - [Visual Studio 2013 Community
    Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)

Snip from the FAQ on that page:

 And here's how they talk about Community Edition
