\*\* **Update**: Due to technical difficulties with the WMV file, the
link for the download has been taken down. 
[Duncan](http://blogs.msdn.com/duncanma/) assures me it will be up soon.

The Whiteboard with Anders cabana session from TechEd ~~is now~~ will
soon be on MSDN TV for download. You'll get to hear Anders take live
questions from the audience and whiteboard the explanation. 

Thanks to Erica and Duncan for making this happen
