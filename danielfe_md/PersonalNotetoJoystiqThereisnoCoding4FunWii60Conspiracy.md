I found this amusing, as I am a Joystiq fan, but I thought I would give
a quick Q\&A response and assure Sony fans that there is, in fact, no
conspiracy :)

  - **Who wrote the guide? **
    [Clint](http://www.betterthaneveryone.com/) and I did and we *did
    not* get any input from the Xbox team
  - **Why did you add the Wii Remote Controller?** Because it's hackable
    in the sense that Microsoft developers can program against it.
    That's the goal of Coding4Fun, to show fun and cool things that
    Microsoft developers can program with. I only wish Nintendo would
    have put a more open, supported API for their controller, but
    hopefully that will happen in the future.
  - **Why didn't we add other competing products?**  The reason Flight
    Simulator X was added is because for the first time in 10 years,
    Flight Simulator has an open API that Microsoft developers can
    program. The fact that it's a Microsoft product is just gravy. In
    fact, the majority of the presents in the gift guide are not
    Microsoft owned products. If you can find other products that
    Microsoft developers can program, then yeah, we'll add them -
    <code4fun@microsoft.com>. 
  - **Where did you get the price from?** Where possible, we decided to
    use Amazon.com for all gifts in the Gift Guide and that was the
    cheapest new and used price at the time the guide was published. The
    new and used price is actually pricier now ($64), likely because of
    the many folks interested in tinkering with the remote as well.

 

Again, there is no grand conspiracy, if it's programmable using
Microsoft tools and [not
illegal](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/article.aspx?articleid=1227688),
then we'll showcase it, the same way Coding4Fun has programmable
articles on [Google's Search
API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/web/services/article.aspx?articleid=912079&title=Using+the+Google+Web+Service),
[Yahoo's Flickr
Service](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/web/services/article.aspx?articleid=1126978&title=Flickr-ing+about+with+.NET) or
how to read your [music library from
iTunes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/windows/article.aspx?articleid=913191&title=Displaying+Your+iTunes+Library). We
didn't, for example, showcase Microsoft's big gift for this holiday
season, the [Zune](http://www.zune.net/), because **it's not
programmable.**
