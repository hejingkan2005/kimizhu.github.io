As many customers, like [Frans Bouma](http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma)Â and
many others have pointed out, its too hard to get a hotfix for Visual
Studio as this involves actually calling support to gain access. Well,
there's a pilot program aimed at helping fix this launched by the DDCPX
team (read [Josh's announcement
here](http://blogs.msdn.com/jledgard/archive/2006/10/31/download-hotfixes-without-contacting-support.aspx))
that should help this. It's only a pilot program right now, so not all
hotfixes are available, but it's great seeing us nudge the door open a
little wider on transparency.
