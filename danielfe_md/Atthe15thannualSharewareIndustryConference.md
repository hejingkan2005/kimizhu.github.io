I'm way too busy at the [Shareware Industry
Conference](http://www.sic.org), but here's a quick brain dump.

I met with John Lueders of [ElmSoftware](http://www.elmsoftware.com/)
who created [iDo 2005](http://www.elmsoftware.com/ido/), some very cool
looking and useful Wedding software. It's got 5 stars by CNET. I can
tell you that my wife, Angie, would have loved this software. We talked
about adding some cool features based on things that I remember Angie
complaining about and even expanding into creating a mobile version. If
you're getting married, check this out... 

I also spoke with David Mahon, FBI Supervisory Special Agent after his
"Cyber Crime" session. His wife works at Microsoft and he's definitely
an interesting guy. He told us some stories about how hackers would
break into companies and extort them for money or else they would
release their entire customer database (credit cards and all). To show
that they had access to this data, they would send them the full list of
customers who's names started with the letter "A" and demand to be payed
or else they would release the full list of customers. Ouch\!

Michael Lehman has an interesting post about the [history of Microsoft
and
Shareware](http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2005/07/14/438936.aspx)
and how the term "shareware" came from from Bob Wallace, Microsoft
employee \#9.
