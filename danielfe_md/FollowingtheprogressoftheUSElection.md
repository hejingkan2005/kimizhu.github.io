I officially voted today, but I avoided the lines by using an absentee
ballot. It really is the way to go. Someone internally sent out a link
to this nice site on CNN that let's you track the results of the US
election: <http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/president/>

You'll need Flash to view the map, but it gives you the state-by-state
results as they come in, and you can even zoom in to see specific
counties. Very cool.
