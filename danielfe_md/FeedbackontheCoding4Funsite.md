We've gotten a lot of really positive feedback on the [Code4Fun
email](mailto:code4fun@microsoft.com) alias and even some like-minded
readers who are interested in contributing content. I think this is
great and I'm really excited about having the community contribute.

We've also gotten some not-so-good feedback that we've taken and
addressed.

1.  Request: *Add an RSS Feed*.
    [Complete](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/rss.xml). We always
    planned to have an RSS feed for the site and per-column, but the
    problem with this was really one of schedule. Kent from the MSDN
    team worked ungodly hours the last two weeks to get Beta 2 out the
    door and I'd rather we got the site up with no RSS feed then no site
    at all. The per-category RSS feeds will be added soon. 
2.  Feedback: Some people
    ([1](http://www.larkware.com/dg3/TheDailyGrind604.html),
    [2](http://blogs.xceedsoft.com/plantem/PermaLink.aspx?guid=2339b234-dfd6-48df-854c-6901e2643648))
    didn't like the tattoo guy picture.
    [Complete](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/). We're having our
    most talented graphic designers adding a tattoo that says "Mom" in a
    red heart to [our
    new picture](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/images/c4f-poster-tattoodude.jpg).

Thanks everyone for the feedback so far\!
