While ordering international power converters from
[mobileplanet.com](http://www.mobileplanet.com), I broke down and
ordered the [Kensington
WiFinder](http://www.kensington.com/html/3720.html).  It's basically a
keychain that notifies you when you're in a wireless hotspot.  Not bad
for $35, and now finding a hotspot is now a walk in the park ;)  
The one addition I would love would be GPS and some sort of memory so
that I can record where the hotspots are.

I already have a USB keychain which has come in very handy, and with the
addition of the Wifi Finder I don't want to add another, but the new
[Philips](http://www.consumer.philips.com/global/b2c/ce/catalog/category.jhtml;jsessionid=VM1THNQVUNH22CRQNAVRYUYKGBUTSHD0?divId=0&groupId=COMMUNICATIONS_GR&catId=TEMP_INNOVATIONS1_CA)
audio keychain (left) and the camera keychain, if only they could
combine them into one keychain:

 Still on my wish list is KVH's [TracVision
A5](http://www.kvh.com/tracvision/a5/index.asp) mobile satellite tuner
which allows you to watch satellite TV anywhere (mount to the top of
your car).  It's pricey at $3499.99 on
[Crutchfield.com](http://www.crutchfield.com), but hopefully by the time
I can afford it, it will have both internet and WiFi access and I will
have a car with a hard top
:)

As a good blog citizen, I will of course let you know how good the WiFi
Finder actually works...
