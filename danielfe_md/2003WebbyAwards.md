Have you
[voted](http://www.webbyawards.com/main/webby_awards/nominees.html) yet?
You only have two more days to place your vote for the People's Choice
awards\! I love the Webby awards as they cover the coolest stuff in
the web's underbelly, and you have to appreciate the fact that their
acceptance speeches are limited to five words (or less). 

My predictions for this year's winners in the People's Choice awards,
based on how much \*I\* use said web site, how many pieces of email I
receive about said site, and my gut feeling:

  - Technical Achievement: [Google](http://www.google.com) - Get Google
    Hacks the book if you haven't yet, great for Google lovers
  - Services: [NetFlix](http://www.NetFlix.com) - I just recently
    started using this and it rocks\!
  - Film: [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com) - They may just win
    Audio too, based on hype, I've been using MRQE a lot lately too, but
    metacritic does games too :)
  - Net Art: [PuppetTool](http://www.lecielestbleu.com/puppettool)
  - Print+Zines: [The Onion](http://www.theonion.com)

I really think they should add a category for web services, I would love
to see a competition between
[Ebay](http://developer.ebay.com/DevProgram/),
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html/102-2346120-4425762),
[MapPoint](http://www.microsoft.com/mappoint/net/), and
[Google](http://www.google.com/apis/) for the best XML Web service.

Who do you think will win this year's awards and who would win the
fictitious Web services awards?
