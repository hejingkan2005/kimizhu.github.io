A lot of long hours and hard work later, we officially launched
[Popfly](http://www.popfly.com/) as a private alpha\!\!

Â 

**What the heck is it?**

Popfly is the fun, easy way for anyone to build and share mashups,
gadgets, Web pages, and applications. Popfly consists of two parts:

1\. Popfly Creator is a set of online visual tools for building Web
pages and mashups.

2\. Popfly Space is an online community of creators where you can host,
share, rate, comment and even remix creations from other Popfly users.

See the [video here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91175) for
how to easily use online services like Flickr, Digg, and even World of
Warcraft without writing code.

I'll write more about Popfly when I get a chance to "breathe" but I'm
really, really excited at the potential for Popfly to **democratize
development**.
