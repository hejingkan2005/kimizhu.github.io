What is Whitehorse you might ask? Below is the text on “Whitehorse” from
the [Visual Studio
Roadmap](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx)

*With Visual Studio Whidbey, Microsoft will deliver a set of tools
(code-named "Whitehorse") that enable architects and developers to
easily design service-oriented applications and operations
infrastructure simultaneously. Whitehorse uses a drag-and-drop design
surface to connect XML Web services, and then validates the resulting
applications against the deployment environment. The designers will
provide modeling support for describing applications and components,
along with corresponding policy for security, protocols, and
more.*
