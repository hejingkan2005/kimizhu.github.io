At Maker Faire, I got to meet the local guys from SVC who came to help
out at the booth, including [Anand Iyer](/aniyer/). Anand is part of the
national Microsoft team (like [Geoff](/gsnowman/)
and [Rory](http://www.neopoleon.com/blog/)) that does MSDN events and
they have several upcoming events you should definitely check out.
Anand's got a [full schedule of west coast events
here](/aniyer/archive/2006/04/17/577386.aspx) including Vegas, Honolulu,
and San Diego....shweet.
