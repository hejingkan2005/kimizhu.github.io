\[Aside: Can you tell I'm cleaning out my blog queue? I'm on a
productivity rampage, only 46 more entries to go. Some posts I can
delete, b/c frankly they are outdated ex: *Who are you going to vote for
this November?* *Happy Halloween\!* etc\]

Don Box uses one of my favorite Visual Studio 2005 features,
[IntelliSense Code
Snippets](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/2005/overview/productivity/#expansions)
(formerly Expansions) and he's created some [XML Schema
snippets](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2004/11/13/3486.aspx)Â that
make writing WSDL a breeze. Download
