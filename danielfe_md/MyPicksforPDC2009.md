With a little over a month to go before Microsoft’s biggest and best
developer event, I wanted to pick out which [PDC
sessions](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions) look super interesting
(<span class="underline">*to me*</span>) this year:

**Dan’s picks**

  - [Windows 7 Developer Boot
    Camp](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/WKSP08) (Mark Russinovich,
    Arun Kishan)– I’ll be setting up some projects during this time, but
    it would be great to go to this workshop. Note that this is FREE and
    you don’t have to be registered for PDC to go to it.
  - [Building Live Media Viewing Experiences using IIS Smooth
    Streaming](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVR14) (Vishal Sood) –
    We’re looking to add Smooth Streaming to Channel 9 so any details on
    the programmability would be appreciated, plus seeing how they did
    the NFL player will be interesting
  - [Code Contracts and Pex Go to a NerdDinner with ASP.NET
    MVC](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/VTL01) (Manuel Fahndrich, Peli
    de Halleux) – How to take an existing application and apply Pex for
    parameterized unit testing and code contracts for improved static
    checking
  - [Visual C\# IDE Tips and
    Tricks](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT35) (DJ Park) – As I used
    to give this talk back in the day, it’ll be interesting to see how
    it’s evolved for Visual Studio 2010
  - [Microsoft AJAX Library, jQuery and Visual
    Studio 2010](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT29) (Stephen
    Walther) – How VS 2010 will make building AJAX apps better
  - [ASP.NET MVC 2: The New
    Stuff](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT22) (Stephen Walther) –
    ‘Nuff said
  - [How Visual Studio 2010 was built with
    WPF 4](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/CL09) (none listed) – This
    should be a great talk for anyone who wants high performance WPF and
    that has a legacy Win32 code base
  - [Dynamic binding in C\# 4](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT31)
    (Mads Torgersen) – Everything that I’ve seen about C\# 4.0’s dynamic
    features makes me fall in love all over again
  - [Networking and Web Services in
    Silverlight](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT31) (none listed)–
    Interested in the “server push” pattern mentioned for scenarios like
    real-time chat
  - [Introduction to SQL Server 2008 R2
    StreamInsight](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVR07) (Torsten
    Grabs) – I know nothing about StreamInsight, but it’s a “platform”
    for processing data over real-time events (with LINQ) so I’m
    thinking a Twitter or Facebook scanner
    [Coding4Fun](http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun) project would be
    great for this
  - [Future Directions for C\# and Visual
    Basic](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT11) (Luca Bolognese) –
    Luca is always an amusing speaker and I’m sure this will be a fun
    session
  - [Advanced Diagnostics, Historical Debugging and Test
    Automation](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT16) (Habib Heydarian)
    – Speaking of entertaining speakers, Habib’s session on cool new
    testing/debugging features for VS 2010 is another can’t-miss
    session.
  - [Silverlight Roadmap and
    Futures](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/P09-11) (Karen Corby) –
    Your first look at Silverlight 4
  - [Developing Advanced Applications with Windows
    Azure](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVC16) (Steve Marx) – Steve
    always builds cool demos (like faking how to be a CIA agent) and I’m
    sure this talk won’t disappoint
  - [Windows Azure Present and
    Future](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVC13) (Manuvir Das) – As I
    haven’t played with Azure yet, this should be a great place to start
    and to see their roadmap for the future
