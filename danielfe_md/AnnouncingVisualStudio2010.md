Since I'm a Visual Studio fanboy, I love hearing about the future of
Visual Studio, now officially named Visual Studio 2010.  While the team
is taking a measured approach to disclosure, something they haven't done
in VS 2005/2008, I did get the scoop on the future of Visual Studio Team
System with Norman Guadagno, the Director of Product Management on what
the key themes are for this release.

System 2010](https://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Dan/Norman-Guadagno-Announcing-Visual-Studio-Team-System-2010/)  

 

There's a lot more coming and [Brian
Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel) from Channel 9 has a ton more
videos coming this week with demos all week long on the [Channel 9
Visual Studio site](https://channel9.msdn.com/).

While the team is primarily discussing Visual Studio Team System now, as
Norman alludes to, you can expect to hear about a whole slew of new
features at the [Professional Developer's
Conference](http://www.microsoftpdc.com) in October, and some more at
[TechEd
Europe 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/emea/teched2008/developer/default.aspx)
in November.

 

**What about bits?  
**Unfortunately the team hasn't released any public bits that you can
play with to try these features hands on.
