[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/), [Jeff
Sandquist](http://radio.weblogs.com/0124699/) and I met a couple of
weeks ago to discuss what sort of blogger events we could do for PDC,
and we'll be sending out details sometime soon.Â  It was cool to finally
meet Scoble in person as I'm a big fan of his blog.

There will hopefully also be a BOF on blogging,, but you'll have to vote
for it on the [INETA](http://www.ineta.org/bof/) site:

  - Weblogging: The Future of Conversational Software - Robert
    McLaws-Interscape Technologies, Inc.
  - You can read more about this entry at, as you might've guessed,
    [Robert's blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/posts/26409.aspx).

Place your vote today :)
