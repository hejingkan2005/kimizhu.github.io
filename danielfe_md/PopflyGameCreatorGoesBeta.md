Congrats to the Popfly team for moving Popfly Game Creator from alpha to
Beta and adding a bunch of handy features. For the full rundown, check
out the [Popfly Team
Blog](http://popflyteam.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!51018025071FD37F!321.entry). 

Here's a few of **my** favorite features

 

**Inserting images into a game**

  - **Alpha (before)**: You had to manually build XAML and manually
    upload images for an actor and make sure the URL is
  - **Beta (after)**: Native support for adding images to an actor

 

**Playing Audio**

  - **Alpha (before)**: Popfly let you play built-in sounds with no
    code, but if you wanted to play a custom sound clip required custom
    JavaScript code
  - **Beta (after)**: No code to play custom sounds

 

**Testing Different Scenes**

  - **Alpha (before)**: You had to manually play the game to get a scene
    or add a custom keyboard shortcut to load a scene
  - **Beta (after)**: Built-in support for previewing any scene

 

**Customizable actor collisions**

  - **Alpha (before):** Your actor "hit box" (the area for actor
    collisions) was either a square or a circle and you could \*not\*
    make it smaller
  - **Beta (after):** You can drag and drop the hit box and make it
    larger or smaller

 

All-in-all, lots of good, meaty features for Game Creators.
