I'm currently in sleep deprivation mode, which always reminds me of how
Henry Rollins begins his spoken word <span class="underline">Boxed
Life</span> tapes:

\[Henry Rollins screaming\]  
*"OPEN YOUR EYES\! YOUR EYES, WIDE, YOU IDIOT\!"*

\[In a much calmer tone\]  
*"Me and the cab driver both slept the whole way to the airport."*

As I was leaving work yesterday (or early today, depending on your
perspective) I noticed someone sleeping on the futon in the common area
of our floor.  I didn't really think anything of it, as this is about
the only company where odd behavior late at night is pretty
commonplace.  The only somewhat questionable thing was his appearance,
as Microsoft lets people dress however they want (within reason), and
because of his tattered clothes he looked like he might be homeless, but
I figured he was just a developer.  Ari, who came in to find him this
morning, also wondered the same thing and apparently even poked him to
see if he was still alive (he was). 

Which, in my cognitive-deficient state, brings me to this funny site
which asks the question - can you tell a coder from a cannibal?  Its an
[online test](http://www.malevole.com/mv/misc/killerquiz/) to see if you
can tell whether the picture you are looking at is that of a serial
killer or a programming language inventor.  This is a classic...
