There was a company meeting today at 9am to say goodbye to Bill with
Bill and Steve. MSNBC wrote an [article on the
meeting](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25417555/?GT1=43001), here's a
quick snippet:

 

> *On his final full day at Microsoft Corp., Bill Gates went on stage to
> reminisce with his longtime friend Steve Ballmer, and neither man
> could hold back tears as Ballmer handed Gates a large scrapbook as a
> farewell present.*

> ...

> *..He was introduced to fellow freshman Ballmer by a mutual friend. On
> their first date, they went to the movies to see an unlikely
> back-to-back showing of "Singing in the Rain" and "A Clockwork
> Orange."*
> 
> *Ballmer, who has famously danced and jumped around stage at
> conferences, described a similarly silly and uninhibited Gates that
> evening.*
> 
> *"So we come back from the movie, we're kind of dancing, we're both
> kind of playing Gene Kelly, and some guy wrestles me to the ground in
> our dorm," Ballmer said. It fell to Gates, who hardly qualifies as
> burly, to fend off the fellow student.*

 

Bill, you will be missed :(
