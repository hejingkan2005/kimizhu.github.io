Woohooo, the [Made In Express contest](http://www.madeinexpress.com/)
officially launched today\!

First some background, one of the things we wanted to do was create a
different kind of contest. While we don't have American Idol money and
since we can't get Bill Gates to hire an Apprentice, we still wanted to
make a different kind of contest.

**Entering is as easy as submitting an idea  
**The typical developer contest involves a participant developing an
application from scratch to enter. In the Made In Express contest, all
you need to do to enter is [submit your
idea](http://www.madeinexpresscontest.com/entry.asp).

**Getting to know the finalists and their work**  
Out of all the ideas, we'll pick 12 finalists and each one will have a
dedicated blog for their project. That way, you get to hear and follow
along similar to [Project Aardvark](http://projectaardvark.com/).

**Make the prize worth it  
**The Grand Prize is **$10,000** cold hard cash, and if you're one of
the 12 finalists, you (obviously) have a 1-in-12 chance of winning the
grand prize. There's also a first prize award for $1,000, and even a
$1,000 Community Award.

**Both you and well-known judges pick the winner**  
For ther grand prize and first prize, Robert Scoble, Phil Torone, and a
mystery judge will pick the winners. In addition, we'll have American
Idol-esque voting for the community award where \*you\* get to pick the
best project.
