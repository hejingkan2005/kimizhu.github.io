I'm back from [VS Connections](http://www.vsconnections.com), the demos
for my talk went off pretty smoothly and I got to meet lot's of great
people.  The people I talked to were really excited about C\# 2005, and
I got to show off some of the cool, new features that came online in the
Community Tech Preview. I'm off to San Jose to present to
[Juval's](http://longhornblogs.com/jlowy/) user group tomorrow. The fun
doesn't stop :)
