I'm back from Bora Bora, and I'm missing it already. The honeymoon was
amazing and I highly recommend Bora Bora and the [Bora Bora Nui Spa and
Resort](http://www.boraboranui.com) to anyone considering a vacation in
the south pacific. I'll write more details on Bora Bora later :)

The wedding went really well, and when I came back to the office I
discovered it had been festively decorated with streamers from the
ceiling and pictures from both the wedding and bachelor party (I'm being
"carried" in one of them) thanks to
[Keller](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/briankel/), but I plan to get him
back soon enough \[insert evil laugh\].

Thanks to everyone for their well wishes for the marriage/honeymoon,
I'll try and blog later this week, but my inbox had 4K+ messages and was
blocked from receiving mail. Gotta love Microsoft :)
