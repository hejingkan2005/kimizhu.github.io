[Scott Nonnenberg](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottno/), [Brian
Goldfarb](http://blogs.msdn.com/bgold/), me, and lots of others are
making the trek across the atlantic to [TechEd
Europe](http://www.microsoft.com/europe/teched/) (in Amsterdam) next
week.  I haven't been to Amsterdam since I was a young pup (\~13 years
old) and I have a feeling it'll be a slightly different experience :) 
I'll be blogging all the gory details of course, and
[www.techedbloggers.net](http://www.techedbloggers.net/) is the place to
visit for the lastest blogger info on TechEd Europe.

I'll be giving a couple of talks on C\# and Java migration

  - DEV321: Visual C\# 2005: IDE Enhancements for the C\# Developer
  - DEV322: Visual C\# 2005: Language Enhancements
  - DEV380: Migrating MSJVM and Other Java-Based Applications to the
    .NET Framework

 

One of the best things about going to events like TechEd are the
parties. You get to hang out with people like [Scott
Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b833aaa4-6270-4ddd-9752-4b5fbdccb62e),
Bill Evjan and of course [Mary Jo](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/).

Speaking of parties, the SQL and VS teams are sponsoring a party on June
30th at [Werck](http://www.werck.nl/) (it just won't feel like work),
but invitations are limited.  [Matt's got the full
details](http://sqljunkies.com/WebLog/mattnunn/archive/2004/06/21/3239.aspx)
on what hoops you have to jump through to get invited.
