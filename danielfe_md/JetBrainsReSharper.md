[JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/), the creators of the [IntelliJ
IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) Java development tool, have an
early release version of a Visual Studio .NET add-in for C\# called
[ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/).  You can learn more
about ReSharper by viewing [Luke
Hutteman's](http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2004/02/14-163.html) and
[Michael
Yuan's](http://weblogs.asp.net/juntao/archive/2004/02/17/74965.aspx)
blog posts  to get their first impressions.  ReSharper is currently in
the early access program, so you should be able to download and test
drive for yourselves.  It would be interesting to see how these compare
against other add-ins that provide refactoring in Visual Studio like:

  - [C\#
