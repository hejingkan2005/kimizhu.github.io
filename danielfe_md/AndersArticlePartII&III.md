Bill Venners has released [Part
II](http://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs.html) and [Part
III](http://www.artima.com/intv/simplexity.html) of his interview series
with Anders Hejlsberg on the C\# Language Design Process.  There's some
great discussion on topics such as why C\# does not have checked
exceptions like Java, simplicity versus simplexity, *the beauty of
delegates* \[my words\], and explaining how C\# is classified as
a component-oriented language. 

Speaking of component-oriented programming,  one of the things that has
definitely chanaged is the approach to programming.  Rather then
creating one big monolothic application, applications are divided into
multiple components.  In fact, one could argue that programming the .NET
framework is less about writing code from scratch but instead the
process is really about linking pre-built components to achieve a
specific task.  

For those of you attending
[PDC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc) this year, Anders will be
presenting the Visual C\# "Whidbey": Language Enhancements session :)

PS:  In case you missed Part I of the Interview series, you can find it
