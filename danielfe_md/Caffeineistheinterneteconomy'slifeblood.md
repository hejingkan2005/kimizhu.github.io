Caffeine is the internet economy's life blood. Yeah, that's a bold
statement, but when your entire industry is over-worked, you should
realize that there are complimentary things that we owe a great deal of
debt to our success.

Personally, I'm suffering from some bad sleep depression and exhaustion
right now. Today, I **<span class="underline">can not</span>** function
without caffeine. My "sleep bank" has been exhausted and angry creditors
beg for just a minute of rest. Not going to happen this week. I only
have one ~~cup of coffee~~ *Ghetto Mocha*tm (see recipe at the end of
this post) a day so that I won't build too much of a caffeine tolerance.
Coffee is my poison of choice, as it's convenient, ubiquitous, has less
calories then Mountain Dew, and more caffeine then anything. What's your
favorite pick me up?

If you are lacking sleep and you want to get the most caffeine per 12oz,
the chart below should help you determine how to get your fix:

**Source**: [Wilstar.com has breakdown of caffeine by
drink](http://wilstar.com/caffeine.htm) taken from the National Soft
drink Assoc, FDA, Bunker and McWilliams and Pepsi.  My problem is
they don't calculate the right quantities (ex: comparing 8oz of coffee
to 12oz of soda). As such, below is the sorted list of caffeine
quantities across both sodas and coffee (using the conservative
estimates for coffee) for 12oz drinks. Bottom line, if you need your
fix, order six espressos (2oz each \* 6 =  12 oz), a 12oz coffee, or two
red bulls.  Aside - Who knew Pepsi One was stronger then Mountain Dew?\!

Despite my
[Colombian](http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/co.html)
[heritage](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/south_america/colombia/),
I don't like the taste of coffee, I certaintly don't take it black, and
I simply don't understand why anyone would ever want decaffinated coffee
(unless their in coffee rehab and need a placebo).  I need some cream
and sugar or other flavors to offset the bitter taste. Which brings me
to a delicious recipe for office/cube dwellers everywhere, the ***Ghetto
Mocha***tm.

  - Mix 1 packet of Farmer Brothers hot chocolate mix (No sugar added
    variety is better) with 12oz fresh coffee. Stir vigorously and
    enjoy.
