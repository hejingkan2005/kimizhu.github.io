answer the question of whether Microsoft should be micro-sized in
another post. Instead I'll specifically address why I think our sales
force should not be
cut.</span>

used to work as a Developer Evangelist in the [Microsoft Mid-Atlantic
district](http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/info/usaoffices/midatlantic/default.mspx)
where I was responsible for evangelizing the .NET vision and our
developer tools story. Our group was responsible for commercial (aka
non-government) sales for Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and
Washington DC. For those of you who may not know, The greater
Washington, DC area has a very large tech base, consisting of large
telecom/ISP companies ([America Online](http://www.aol.com/)), huge tech
consulting/outsourcing companies ([Booz Allen
Hamilton](http://www.boozallen.com/), [Computer Science
Corporation](http://www.csc.com/), [BAE
Systems](http://www.baesystems.com/)), government-assisted
corporations ([Amtrack](http://www.amtrack.com/), [Fannie

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">Our
goal was to meet with these organizations, understand their needs and
evangelize how our technology will help provide the best solution
possible. This involves everything from providing your typical "What is
.NET" overview talk to CxO's to discussing more obscure topics like
creating section 508 compliant web pages using ASP.NET or creating
working prototypes of actual solutions. So how many Microsoft employees
do you think we had covering **developers and architects** for all of
the companies in our district and all of our [MSDN
events](http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032261148)?
Would you believe three people, two of which were technical? David
Goodhand, a Microsoft legend as the Microsoft Outlook Product
Planner (circa Outlook '97) and a great mentor was the Architect
Evangelist, I was the Developer Evangelist and we had a sales manager
who took care of actually closing the deal, licensing, etc. We were (and
probably still are) understaffed in addressing direct customer
relations. In deals where we actually got to meet with the customer, and
tell them our story, our success rate was incredibly high. If we show
up, we win, it's was that easy. Frankly, there are some customers I
never met with, and others I only met with once a year. Would you spend
your ever-dwindling IT budget on a vendor you meet for two hours a year
or with the person who's always there for you, and who has spent the
time to study and understand your business needs? I can't tell you how
many meetings I went to where it was the first time they had ever met
someone from Microsoft.  In fact my role as a developer evengelist
didn’t exist until around 2001. Selling to an enterprise, and I'm
referring to getting the big wins, is not
easy. </span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">**Enterprise**</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">
**Sales Process**
    </span>

  - <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">**Long
    Sales Cycle**: Selling to an enterprise is a tough process with a
    sales cycle that can be longer then 18 months.
    </span>
  - <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">**Long
    implementation cycle**: Complex applications can take several years
    to
    implement.</span>
  - <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">**Complex
    Needs**: Large enterprises have complex software needs. Deploying
    SAP to run your line of business applications is not trivial and
    requires expert advice to do it right. So does architecting any
    mission critical application. Throwing a product out on the market
    and assuming it will sell just won't work.
    </span>
  - <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">**Approval**:
    Some enterprises have architect councils which standardize
    application development across the organization or subsidiary.
    Before a line of code is written, you need to convince this group
    the value of having your technology be an approved standard. Your
    product may be better then sliced bread, but if it's not approved,
    it's not
    happening.</span>
  - <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">**Skin
    in the Game**: Customers expect a joint investment in a solution.
    This is an area where IBM truly excels. IBM is more interested
    in being a trusted advisor and is willing to put “skin in the game”
    by investing money in a customer’s solution. For big name companies,
    IBM is willing to invest (or comp) software, services, support and
    infrastructure to ensure the customer is successful. It’s piece of
    mind, customers know that IBM is going to do what it takes to make
    sure everything’s working. Contrast that with the Microsoft approach
    where you are just selling a product, oh and you don’t get free
    support. The marketplace has already decided which mechanism works
    for enterprise
    software.</span>
  - <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">**History/Relationship**:
    We have customers who have been IBM purchasing products from IBM for
    25+ years. They have a personal relationship with the salesperson,
    who has been working for the account all those
    years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Approximately \~70%
    of their IT budget goes to IBM, 5% of it goes to Microsoft.
    </span>
  - <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">**Politics
    and Bias**: There are also plenty of other issues, ranging from
    geo-political policy to only use open source in Europe and Asia to
    out-and-out technology bigots. While you can at best contain the
    latter, the former requires much more effort. This also ties back to
    my approval point above, but imagines if Microsoft technology
    couldn’t even be considered by government agencies because it
    wasn’t open source. That’s bad for us and our customers.
</span>

**<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">Moral
of the
story</span>**<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-language: #EC54">:
While I agree that one should measure the ROI of a sales force or any
investment for that matter, implying that our sales force should be cut
shows an ignorance of the enterprise software sales process. Microsoft
can't be considered a trusted advisor in an enterprise without a
significant investment in time, money, resources, and people.
