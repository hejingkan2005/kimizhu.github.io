Happy holidays to all, I'm back from a well-rested vacation and looking
forward to taking on the new year. As usual, I made the same empty
promises, lose weight, eat healthier, blog more, etc. We'll see how I
hold up. (Much) More importantly, my condolences and thoughts go out to
those in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Maldives, and all other
affected areas of the Tsunami.
