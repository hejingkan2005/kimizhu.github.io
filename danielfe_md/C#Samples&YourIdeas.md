### C\# Samples

We recently posted [23 C\# Code
Samples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/downloads/samples/23samples/default.aspx)
on MSDN for your development pleasure.  The samples answer some popular
questions and should "just work".  Here are just some of the topics
covered to wet your appetite: 

  - Custom Attributes
  - Code Access Security
  - Callbacks and Delegates
  - COM+

### Your Ideas

\[putting on marketing hat\]

We want your ideas and feedback for C\# samples\!  Do you have a
pressing question that you want sample code for?  Do you have a great
idea that you want someone else to write the code for?  Here's your
chance to have your  questions and ideas turned into real code for the
next release of our C\# samples.  You can tell your friends how cool you
are when we use your idea for the next release of C\# samples (and I'll
even vouch for you).  You can respond on this blog, or email me at
<danielfe@microsoft.com>.
