Microsoft and CareerBuilder recently announced a new partnership aimed
at helping Visual Studio developers find jobs through a [new
portal](http://www.careerbuilder.com/express/) with links to .NET jobs,
salaries, and even learning content for job switchers. **I love this**,
many props to Doug, [Chris](http://blogs.msdn.com/christ/) and everyone
that helped make this happen. My personal opinion is that technology
companies need to do a much better job of increasing their customers
skills and in making sure they are  aware of the career opportunities
available to them. Why? Because technology choice is more than a logical
exericse, there's an emotional aspect that is way too often ignored and
underserved.  If we can help Microsoft developers be employed better
than other vendor, we win. I'm definitely excited on how we could even
expand this to help employ Micosoft DBA's and System Administrators.

If you have other suggestions for how we can help customers be a better
partner in your career, let us know.
