[Ed](http://www.sharplogic.com/blogs/ed/) emailed me that the [NHL
owners and players have finally made
peace](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8497562/) and there will be hockey
next year. The question is, will the fans come? This [MSNBC article has
some interesting quotes](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6981261/). The
first two sum up my feelings, especially since I immediately responded
to Ed saying that we need to make a road trip to Vancouver to catch a
game (there is no Seattle NHL team much to my dismay). The last one
highlights the fact that the NHL has to really reach out to its fan base
and make things right.

*Until today I had forgotten how much I missed the game. All day I
couldn't stop thinking about it. Personally, I am glad it is over and am
excited to see them back on the ice\!  
****— Dan Earl from Phoenix*****

*Now that they finally got the job done that they were hired to do,
Goodenow and Bettman should be fired. In my job, if I ever messed up an
assignment this badly, not only would I lose my job, but I'd probably
never find work again.  
****— Leslie from Tucson, Ariz.*****

*I will not purchase tickets to a game for at least a year. See how they
all like it.  
****— Johnny Davis from Arl, Texas*****
