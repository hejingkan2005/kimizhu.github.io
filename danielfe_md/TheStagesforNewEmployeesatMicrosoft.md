blogged about how, as a new Microsoft employee, he's **drinking through
the firehose** \[FYI to Phil: Brian Goldfarb has been using [this as the
motto on his blog since 2003](http://blogs.msdn.com/bgold), before

and I'd thought I'd add my two cents to the lifecycle of new employees.

Microsoft absolutely has a "sink-or-swim" mentality for new hires
(college or professional hires). That doesn't mean there isn't a vast
support network or mentoring options, but it does mean that, in general
you are given a goal or metric and you can decide how to reach that
goal/metric.  Unlike other companies where you're told what to do, a
good number of jobs at Microsoft, it's up to you to **own the goal or
the problem**.

**Ownership**

Ownership can be a double-edged sword, but it seems to be the most
effective way to address issues. Ownership, to me, means that you or
your team is personally responsible to fix something or meet a goal.
This can be a double-edged sword in that other teams that don't "own"
something often-times won't put resources towards something you depend
on, hence the challenge with cross-group collaboration. In general, I
think ownership is the way things get done around Microsoft and the
times I've seen **shared ownership** work is when all teams involved
have committed to the goal or fixing the problem.

 

**New Employee
Stages**

  - **Stage 1: Incompetence -** When you first join, you're surrounded
    by really smart people and you slowly start to realize that
    <span class="underline">you don't even know how much of what you
    don't know</span>. Whether it's acronyms, confidential projects,
    tools, or systems/processes, there's a ton that you'll be learning.
    In some ways, it's like in the Matrix just staring at a series of
    scrolling green text...
  - **Stage 2: Understanding** - ...then you see the pattern. The pieces
    click together. What was once an undecipherable code becomes clear
    and you start seeing how things work. Things that seemed impossible
    before are now trivial. This is just like at the end of the first
    Matrix movie where Neo is, without much effort at all, able to block
    and parry Agent Smith's attacks.
  - **Stage 3: Execution** - Sometime after your first year, you'll look
    back at your noobish-ness and realize you'd likely do many things
    differently in your first year at Microsoft. You'll also realize
    just how empowered you are to "own" problems and, since you
    understand the Matrix, you know how you can address the problem or
    goal. You have great ideas, you know what the problems are and you
    don't carry the "baggage of broken dreams" that the Jaded PM in
    Stage 5 has. Because you are competent during this stage, you'll
    also get the distinct feeling that the "other teams" you work with
    are "**incompetent**" (they may not be, they likely just don't own
    *your problem*). You strive to "take ownership " of the different
    parts of a problem so you can actually get your work completed
    without dependencies on other teams. I've seen some of the best
    devs/PMs/etc solve a problem that was completely outside of the
    scope of their job/work (say by finding a bug in someone else's
    code) so that they wouldn't be blocked by another team. 
  - **Stage 4: Connecting** - After years of executing, you start to
    build a large set of connections with other teams (in your division,
    business group, or across business groups) and those
    inter-connections become immensely helpful as your problems become
    more complex. Knowing who the PM/GPM/Dev in charge of xyz means that
    you'll be able to get questions answered or resolve issues orders of
    magnitude faster. Microsoft is a really big company and it's only
    after some time that you start to know who all the players are and a
    team that previously told you to "get lost" is now willing to work
    with you as you're relationship with that team means you're not one
    of those other incompetent people.
  - **Stage 5: Kool-aid or Jaded -** After a while, there's a natural
    tendency to move to either LOVE Microsoft or become jaded. This
    isn't to say that the jaded employee is wrong or even a bad
    employee, it's just that there is only so many times that your idea,
    bug, spec, can be rejected before you become bitter at the whole
    process. The jaded PM, or the "realist" PM is also self-infecting,
    attending meetings and shooting down ideas, especially for Stage 2 &
    3 employees that finally get the system and are trying to improve
    what's going on. I cannot tell you the amount of times that someone
    has shot down ideas because they were "impossible" or the "dumbest
    idea I've ever heard" only to have a stage 3 kool-aid employee show
    them that the "impossible" can be done, it didn't require meetings
    with three teams, and it was done in hours, not weeks as was
    previously estimated.

 

The cycle repeats itself as you get promoted (to a new level of
incompetence), switch teams, or switch disciplines (ex: PM to
marketing).

 

To those that are new to Microsoft that are reading this

  - Expect change. It happens constantly.
  - The really big ideas take years (and maybe a different team) to be
    built. Patience and faith are key
  - Make sure you love what you do, don't stop pushing for change that's
    good for your customers, and try not to become a jaded employee.
