*C-omega, is “a research language intended to foster new thoughts and
ideas about programming languages, Cw (pronounced C-omega) is a
combination of what used to be X\#/Xen and Polyphonic C\#. It's an
interesting combination of new ideas, and is most certainly worth a
look.”*

As I've said
[before](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/01/30/65366.aspx),
languages like Xen/X\#, Polyphonic C\#, Cw and many others are research
languages and not a replacement of C\#.
