**(**via [**Slashdot**](http://www.slashdot.com)**)** has coverage on
Movieokie - the idea with Movieokie is just like Karoake, except rather
then singing a song, you act out your favorite movie scene.  I
\***love**\* this idea, in fact

a fellow 'softie, said he was interested in opening up a Movieokie place
in Seattle *\[Aside: If I ever open a bar in a geek-town like Seattle, I
would name it “Foo“\].* Below is a list of classic scenes I would love
to act out:

  - Benicio Del Toro in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (the elevator
    scene)
  - Christopher Walken in Pulp Fiction (Army “debrief“)
  - Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction (“Say what again“ scene)
  - Mel Gibson in Braveheart (Pre-battle speech scene)
  - Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glen Ross (ABC scene)
  - Jamie Kennedy in Scream (moviestore scene)
  - Steve Buscemi in Reservoir Dogs (“you kids shouldn't play so rough“
    scene)
  - Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs (any scene)
  - Jeff Bridges in Big Lebowski (“the carpet really made the room”
    scene)
  - Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse Now (boat arrival scene)
  - Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now (Napalm speech scene)

and of course Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men - “You can't handle the
truth“ scene

What scene would you want to do?
