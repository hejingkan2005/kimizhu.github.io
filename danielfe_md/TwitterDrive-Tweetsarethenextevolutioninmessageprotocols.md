Today we announced TwitterDrive, a free, [open source
application](http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2009/04/01/9525376.aspx)
that will revolutionize cloud storage and cloud applications as we know
it.  Here is an interview with the [TweetDrive creator, Brian
Peek](http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2009/04/01/9525555.aspx)
with the full details.

**What is it?**   
TweetDrive is a .NET application that enables you to use Twitter as a
cloud storage backend to share files, musics, photos, anything

**How does it work?  
**TweetDrive serializes your file into BASE64, splits the file 140
characters at a time and uploads each file chunk to Twitter.

**Does it really work?  
**Yes\! Here's an example Tweet from my TweetDrive account,

<span class="meta entry-meta">**Why use TwitterDrive?**</span>

  - <span class="meta entry-meta">**Infinite Storage -**  There are no
    limits to how many Tweets you can have on Twitter</span>
  - <span class="meta entry-meta">**Leverages Network Effect** - Before
    TwitterDrive, sending files across the network was just from user A
    to user B. Now communication is open and linked in a social graph.
    Social file sharing is the future</span>
  - <span class="meta entry-meta">**Open Protocols** - Since Twitter has
    an open API, all data is accessible via XML which means developers
    will be able to build applications on top of this communication
    stack.</span>

**Evolution of networking  
**I think what you'll see is that Twitter is the next evolution of
message protocols. Traditional communication protocols are
point-to-point (TCP/IP request between you and a Web site) and totally
closed (the exchange is designed to be private between users, outside of
packet sniffers).

It's not just TCP/IP that is closed, other communication protocols or
applications like email, FTP, HTTP, file streaming are closed systems.
Twitter is the future of a communication protocol, it's not only
completely open, it's a protocol that is **social by design.**

I suspect that academics will be re-writing networking books to include
Twitter as the fifth and perhaps final layer on top of the TCP/IP
protocol.

**The Future  
**This is absolutely just the beginning. Imagine how many applications
can be built on top of a totally free, distributed, and social computing
cloud. It won't be long before we see the next BitTorrent client or a
full blown Web site running using Twitter Cloud Storage. I won't be
surprised if the next cloud operating system is distributed and run
directly from Twitter.
