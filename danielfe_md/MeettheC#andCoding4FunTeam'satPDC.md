Woohoo, PDC starts tomorrow\!

Check out the [C\# Developer Center for the full list of C\#
sessions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/community/events/pdc05/default.aspx)
and ways that you can meet the C\# team live and in-person\! If you're
not at PDC, we'll be having an online chat later on this month (more
details soon).

I'll be helping to man the Coding4Fun booth at PDC, along with several
cool companies and the C4f usual suspects including [Kent
Sharkey](http://blogs.msdn.com/ksharkey/), [Brian
Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/), [Ed
Kaim](http://www.sharplogic.com/blogs/ed/) and even the
[Z-Man.](http://www.thezbuffer.com/) Stop by and say "hi" as we'll have
some

off.

your story and you may be up on
