[Thank you Chris Sells
:)](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1599)         

In his post, Chris asks whether all of the [features shown in this
demo](https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=14793) will work in
the other Visual Studio products. The answer is **yes**. The way we've
thought of our products for Visual Studio 2005 is that it's a Russian
doll model, meaning that C\# Express is a subset of Visual Studio 2005
Standard, which is a subset of Visual Studio 2005 Professional, etc,
etc.

You can find a walkthrough of how it works
[here](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/07/26/197811.aspx),
and [EddWo](https://channel9.msdn.com/User/Profile.aspx?UserID=3682) has
made some cool modifications that [you should also play
with](http://www.silverelectron.com/googlesampleupdate.zip).
