Kudos to [Ariel Stallings](http://www.microspotting.com/about),
Microsoft employee and author the
[Microspotting](http://www.microspotting.com) blog (one of my favorite
new blogs) on landing a virtual [Mini-Microsoft
interview](http://www.microspotting.com/2008/02/mini-microsoft#more-71).
My personal opinion of Mini is a bit mixed, and I've [definitely
disagreed with
Mini](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2005/01/12/351676.aspx) in
the past , but it is interesting to hear his perspective, which
blogger's he likes, and that he *thinks* he's made some accidental
slip-ups in the past. A fascinating read.
