Today we officially made available for download the  [Java Language
Conversion
Assistant](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/tools/jlca/)
(JLCA) version 2.0.  The JLCA is a conversion tool that automatically
converts existing java language source files to C\# code. This version
is especially useful for Java web developers as the JLCA now converts
JSPs and servlets to ASP.NET.  You can expect around 80-90% of your code
to migrate without change.  In addition to launching the tool, we're
also launching a [JSP to ASP.NET Migration
Guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/using/migrating/jspmig/default.aspx)
that walks through the real-world migration of
[codenotes.com](http://www.codenotes.com).  If you're a Java developer
interested in learning about or moving to the Microsoft platform, you
should definitely check out the migration guide.

Many thanks to everyone who worked on the JLCA and the JSP to ASP.NET
Migration Guide\!
