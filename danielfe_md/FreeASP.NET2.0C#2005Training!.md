Yes, that's free as in
[beer](http://www.danfernandez.com/view/view.aspx?ID=132).
[AppDev](http://www.appdev.com), a leader in video-based training
and SQL Server Reader's Choice winner, was kind enough to provide **a
portion** of their **[Exploring ASP.NET 2.0 Using Visual
C\# 2005](http://www.appdev.com/prodfamily.asp?catalog%5Fname=AppDevCatalog&category%5Fname=ASPC20Product)**
courseware available for free\! I've personally the ASP.NET 2.0 using
C\# videos and I thought it was really great stuff. It even covered how
to use everyone's favorite buzzword, AJAX (Asynchronous Java And XML),
using the built-in support in ASP.NET 2.0. The training is taught by
Microsoft MVPs Andy Baron, Mary Chipman and Ken Getz.

Highly recommended.
