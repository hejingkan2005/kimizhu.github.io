I wanted to get community feedback on some of the things we're thinking
about for Coding4Fun V2.  Below is a list of changes I sent to some C4F
authors asking their thoughts (many of which I've added below) and I'd
love to hear your feedback:

**Coding4Fun v2 Proposed Changes**

  - **UI Redesign** -  It needs to be done or at least refreshed in my
    opinion.
  - **Content Reorganization** - Right now the content is basically all
    over the place. I’d like to organize and put all of our content into
    four big buckets:  
    1. Hardware  
    2. Windows  
    3. Web  
    4. Gaming
  - **Daily Updates **– I'd love to have daily updates covering the
    topics listed above or other cool, relevant content for C4F'ers. I'm
    thinking something like the awesome work [Phil Torrone does with
    Makezine](http://www.makezine.com/).
  - **Content Submission** – To be honest, this is our biggest pain
    point as it's hard and laborious to get content on Coding4Fun today
    (there are literally 20-pages of detailed instructions). We're going
    back to our original design when we first launched Coding4Fun which
    is to have it driven completely off of a blog the way the home page
    headlines are today. We could even send vendors a customized - Word
    2007 Blog Template that they can fill in and "boom" we're done.
  - **Code Samples** - This is another laborious process that involves
    code-signing bits, obscure tools and, well, human intervention.  For
    the bigger, more complex projects, we can put them on CodePlex,
    while the typical article sample could go on [Channel9's
    Sandbox](https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=31)
  - **Multi-Language** – People like Coding4Fun. They don't like having
    to choose a language to have fun. In short, everywhere possible we
    want both the article snippets and code samples to include both VB
    and C\#.
  - **Community Involvement** – This is a tough one, but I really want
    to enable more community involvement, at its most basic this would
    be ratings and public comments.  I do, however, dream of a Digg-Like
    system where people could rate/Digg code samples 
  - **Coding4Fun Article Ideas **– Wouldn't you love to be able to
    submit some cool idea that you don't know how to do, or to rate
    other people's ideas on what articles are (incredibly talented)
    authors can write about? I would and we may do this by modding the
    connect.microsoft.com infrastructure (think MSDN Product Feedback)
    or by creating a public wiki.
  - **Q\&A/Ask the C4F Writers** - Another idea we've been kicking
    around is having a Q\&A column where you could write in questions
    and our talented authors could .
  - **Content Calendar** – For both our authors, us, and our readers, it
    would be nice to know when articles will be posted or when we'll
    have special editions. For example, we know we’ll be doing a
    Halloween Coding4Fun Guide, a Halloween Gift Guide, and another
    April Fool’s Day guide.
  - **Content Templates** - This is probably minor, but I'd like to add
    metadata to the article so you can see what's involved like:
      - Category: Ex: Gaming
      - Time Required: Ex: 30 minutes
      - Difficulty: Ex: Intermediate
      - Cost: Ex: $39 for used Web cam
      - System Requirements: Ex: Managed DirectX December 2005 CTP, .NET
        Framework 2.0

**Other Off-the-Wall Ideas**

  - **Community, Community, Community** - Understood, we're seeing what
    we can do short term and long term :)
  - **UI Redesign Community Voting** - Call this the
    [Gundelroy-Factor](http://www.larkware.com/), but Mike (and others)
    disliked our [original tattoo'd
    guy](http://www.larkware.com/dg3/TheDailyGrind607.html) on the
    Coding4Fun home page so we like Mike enough to change the picture.
    In short, we can have our graphic designer come up with a couple of
    templates and you, the community, would get to vote on the new site
    design.
  - **C4F'ies** - This would be a once-a-year award for our favorite
    coding projects, hardware, utilities, hacks, mods, best user
    contribution, best reader question, most popular article, and more. 

**Short Term Pain  
**The tough part is that since we're rebuilding our infrastructure, we
won't have new articles updated on the site for a few weeks, but we have
some very cool articles literally sitting in my inbox. Here are two
teasers for the articles I have now: (1) Scott Hanselman and
fingerprints (2) Two Words: Unreal Tournament.  Again, my apologies, but
we'll be back much better than ever soon. 

**Your Feedback**

1.  What do you think about the suggestions above?
2.  If you could change three things about Coding4Fun, what would they
    be?
3.  Do you have any other whacky, crazy ideas that you think we should
    take on?
