As Sara mentioned in the CodePlex blog, we're having a CodePlex meetup
at PDC on Wednesday from 1:30 - 2:30pm where volunteers will be able to
show off their Codeplex projects and you'll be able to check out demos
of new CodePlex features and give the CodePlex team feedback on what
they're delivering.

 Full details on the CodePlex blog:
