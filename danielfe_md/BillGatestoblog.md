The [Seattle
Times](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001964841_gatesblog25.html)
seems to think so.  [Eric
Rudder](http://msdn.microsoft.com/blogs/ericr/) is officially our first
exec to blog (at least not anonymously) and [S.
Somasegar](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/somasegar/default.asp), our
devtool Corporate VP is in on the [action
too](http://blogs.msdn.com/Somasegar/).

I'm trying to think of all the cool things I would want to know about
Bill:

  - Does he believe in [K\&R, Allman
    style](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2003/11/24/51893.aspx)
    or something totally different?
  - What's his favorite programming language?
  - How does he go about learning new technology?
  - Does he play Xbox Live? If so what's his GamerTag?
  - Does he ever get frustrated by losing an Xbox game and throw the
    controller in disgust?
  - Does he answer telemarketing phone calls? How does that go?
  - If he *\***<span class="underline">had</span>\**** to buy a country,
    which one would he buy and why?

What would you want to know?
