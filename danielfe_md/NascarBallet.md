Fascinating, I would totally go see this (from

*“How do you get people in a small Southern city interested in the
performing arts? You do what a ballet company in Roanoke, Virginia did
and develop NASCAR ballet, a show where "modern dancers (who represent
cars) circle a forty foot horseshoe track that banks around the corner
complete with break away railings." And how do you fund such an unusual
project? You follow NASCAR's lead, of course: "As the dancers gracefully
careen around the track, collide and are rebuilt, logos of sponsoring
companies are displayed prominently all over their bodies."“

I brought this up during my TechEd Dallas talk, but Nascar and technical
product demos have a lot in common. You don't go to high speed
performance, you go to see the crashes.
