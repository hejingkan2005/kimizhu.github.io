A couple of weeks ago at CES, [Charlie
Kindel](http://kindel.com/blogs/charlie/) and team launched the newest
version of Windows, Windows Home Server (WHS), a product aimed at making
it easy for anyone, including mom, to setup an automated way to backup
her PCs and to share pictures, movies and more. If you haven’t heard of
Windows Home Server, go check out the [Channel9
video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=270965) where Rory
interviews Charlie Kindel or read [Paul Thurott’s Windows Home Server
Preview](http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/whs_preview.asp), which has
the following final thoughts:

>   
> *“I'm excited about Windows Home Server in a way that I haven't been
> about technology since the first time I laid eyes on Windows Media
> Center ("Freestyle"), back in early 2002. Enthusiasts are going to eat
> this thing up, and once more typical consumers catch on, I suspect
> Windows Home Server is going to find a huge market indeed.”*

  
In the video, you probably heard Charlie mention the WHS team has two
types of customers (personas), the first being the wholly non-technical
person, my mom if you will, the second one being “Sam” who is a
hobbyist/enthusiast developer and is smart enough to know about
technical features in Windows like remote desktop, firewalls, etc. “Sam”
is, in essence, the Express customer as well so our non-pro
team (specifically Doug Handler), has been working with the WHS team on
enabling hobbyist developers to take advantage of WHS. That’s right, the
[Hobbyist
Renaissance](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2006/08/10/694715.aspx)
continues with a new operating system hobbyists can take to the next
level.

 

**Windows Home Server is a platform:**

  - Built using the same technologies found in Windows Server 2003 SP2
  - Includes IIS 6.0 with Service Pack 1
  - Includes the .NET Framework 2.0
  - Includes Windows Media Connect
  - Can host/run almost any custom Windows Service
  - Extensible Management Interface for remote Management  

Since it is a server, this means you can setup your own Web site
“MyOwnSite.com” using services like [Dynamic
DNS](http://www.dyndns.com/), and host

  - Your own [Personal Web
    Site](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/vwd/starterkit/default.aspx#personal)
  - Your own Community/Portal using [.NET
    Nuke](http://www.dotnetnuke.com/) or [Community Server Personal
    Edition](http://communityserver.org/content/GetCommunityServerNow.aspx) 
  - Setup your own Radio Station say “MyOwnDormRoomRadio.com”
  - Setup your own dynamically updating Web cam
  - [Ventrio](http://www.ventrilo.com/) or
    [TeamSpeak](http://www.goteamspeak.com/)
  - Your own game server

**Windows Home Server Management Add-ins  
**We’re also working with the WHS team to create Visual Studio Express
Project Templates to create add-ins/snap-ins to the Home Server
management interface for your own custom application, like a Home
Automation management tool to be able to control your lights from
anywhere.

**Windows Home Server Beta 2**  
Per Charlie, here is what we can say about the plans for the WHS beta:
“*The dev team is wrapping up its Beta 2 milestone now. They should be
done within the next month or so. The Beta will extend beyond Microsoft
employees, but details are murky on how broadly it will be available*.”

**Hobbyist Developer Samples**   
You can certainly expect us to add samples to
[Coding4Fun](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/) on using Home
Server, but what would you be interested in? 

  - Home Automation
  - Web Cams
  - Web sites
  - Stereo controller
  - Telephony using TAPI

Finally, congratulations to the Windows Home Server team for a great
launch\! I can’t wait to set this up at home :)
