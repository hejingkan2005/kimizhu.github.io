**GearGrip**  
The next time you're heading out to that LAN party and you need to
transport  your [tricked
out](http://www.alienware.com/review_pages/review_template.aspx?FileName=review_cnet_041403.asp)
computer, don't carry it by hand, instead use
[GearGrip](http://www.geargrip.com/) to transport both your PC and
monitor. [Tom's Hardware](http://www.tomshardware.com) has the [product
review](http://www6.tomshardware.com/game/20030913/index.html).

**DV Streamer**  
Tom's Hardware also has a
[review](http://www6.tomshardware.com/storage/20030912/index.html) of
software that creates a new way of using one of the oldest backup
technologies around, tape.  A software company
called [DVStreamer](http://www.dvstreamer.com/) has created a way to
use miniDV tapes from camcorders as a simple and more importantly
**cheap** way to backup all your files.  Per the review, the software is
still buggy, but it's a cheap ($50 for the s/w) and easy to backup
8-15gigs on a 60 minute DV tape. Sweet\! In a couple of years, it would
be great to see this refined, less error prone,  and as easy as one
click.  But then again, I hope we won't be using tape in a couple of
years.  I also think [Goldfarb](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/bgold/) needs
to get someone to redesign their site before it's added to the list of
[unmentionables](http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/).
