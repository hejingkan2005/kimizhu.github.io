<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">[Juval
Lowy](http://www.idesign.net/idesign/DesktopDefault.aspx) sent me this
gem of a tip for how to use Skype on a PocketPC leveraging Verizon's
broadband network and have your calls automatically forwarded to your
PocketPC (no more nights and weekends). It also works well when
travelling assuming your hotel has broadband, plus anyone calling you
only pays for local calls</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">You
install on it SkypeIn and SkypeOut for the pocket
PC.</span>

</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">SkypeIn
lets you receives calls on 3 numbers of your choice anywhere in the
world, routed to your pocket PC, has voice mail, etc for a small flat
fee:

</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">SkypeOut
lets you call outside to normal phone numbers for VOIP prices (3 cents a
minute anywhere in the
world):</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Wherever
you are in a WiFi hotspot, your pocket PC becomes your free cell phone.
</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Now, you
sign with Verizon a data deal for unlimited broadband access to their
network using a PCMCIA card ($60 per
month)</span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">You
connect over the Verizon card to the Internet, then use Skype as a cell
phone where there is no WiFi. </span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Net
effect – really cheap cell bill every month, plus you can use the pocket
PC as a modem for your laptop anywhere Verizon has coverage.  </span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I use it
mid-way: When I am on the road in Europe, I have SkypeOut on my laptop,
and I use it as a cell phone, and I listed to my US cell phone voice
messages via it. </span>
