Did I mention I love [Scandinavian airlines
(SAS)?](http://www.scandinavian.net/) I \*LOVE\* them. I plan to fly
them any time I travel across the atlantic Why? Besides being  good
airline, their fleet has been equipped with wireless internet access
throughout the plane (and the **entire** transatlantic fleet). That's
right, for $30 US you can work and surf your entire flight\!\! Not only
that, they have full power cords, so there's no longer a need to carry a
bulky power converter that's only for the plane. On the flight back, I
had a 3-way IM conversation with B1 and B2 on Messenger. It was very
cool if nothing more then for the novelty.

Back to the title of this post, I logged into [World of
Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com), a MMORPG and IMHO one of the
top 10 games \*ever\*. I had some bad initial lag (being
in ~~lag~~IronForge didn't help) and  I started to get a ping time
around 700-2Kms. Not fast enough for Half Life 2, but good enough for
rooting/nuking my way through about 5 HKs before I logged off. I'll have
to post pictures of the dead...

If you're traveling to Europe any time soon, I highly recommend taking
[SAS](http://www.scandinavian.net/).
