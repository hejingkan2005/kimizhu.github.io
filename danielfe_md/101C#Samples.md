Before I forget, [101 C\# Code
Samples](http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/4/7/6474467e-b2b7-40ea-a478-1d3296e78adf/CSharp.msi)
were recently added to MSDNÂ  (thanks
[Duncan](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/)) , here are just some
appetizers of the samples available:

  - Asynchronous/multithreaded programming
  - Socket Programming
  - Garbage Collection basics
  - Automating Internet Explorer in your applications
  - Encrypting and Decrypting data
  - Thread Pooling
  - Using Windows XP Themes

[Sean and Scott](http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/) did the original 101
VB code samples, and I believe they also worked on porting these to C\#.
