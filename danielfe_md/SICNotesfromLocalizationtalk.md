The localization talk had three speakers for a one hour session that ran
a bit over.  Rough notes below

Speaker \#1 Claude Ostfeld  
\<aside\>He literally just read his slides and his slides had way too
much text\</aside  
 - Don't publish prices on the Web \<aside\>Me and an audience member
disagree with the speaker on this one, but when he was asked, he said he
meant for bulk purchases (200+ licenses)\</aside\>  
 - Remote partners need to know they can sell  
 - Treat resellers like key clients, be selective in choosing

Treat a localized version as a brand new product

Don't hardcode english language captions into your software  
   
5 W's of s/w loc  
Where should it be sold  
 - Direct/Inderict  
 - Potential for profit?  
 - Decide where you have the most resources  
 - Local contacts (packaging/marketing)  
 -  
\- Using Google or Altavista  
Don't use automated translations \[French language\]  
  - doesn't sound foreign, sounds weird

Focus more on shrink-wrapped software then localization

Babel Toolbar

Never embed string in your code  
Resource or ini files  
Delphi 2005  
[www.balmsoft.com](http://www.balmsoft.com) for Delphi

Unicode - Double-byte  
 - Asian fonts need larger size (need to make out the strokes)  
 - 9pt as the minimum

BCDS, his company, does localization for French market  
Top Systems for Germany  
Use System font (shelldlg for Delphi)

Localization means more then just translation  
menus, text, dialog  
docus, help  
installation  
icons/graphics (stop sign)  
character set  
Dates and Times  
Currencies ( new Euro symbol)  
Numbers  
right-to-left and left-to-right

Translation Kit - the process of translation  
Don't need to give source code, just resource files

Give  
Resource files, not source code  
Word documents not PDF files  
Help files in a format that can be edited  
Separate code from language

Does your product make sense in other territories? (Tax software,
baseball stats are two examples that won't matter in foreign markets)  
If you build it, will they come? What about sales, marketing, and
support?  
Is it legal? Exporting encryption, copying DVDs - Turkish prisons are no
fun

Prioritize for where you think you'll do the best
