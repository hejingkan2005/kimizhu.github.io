In coordination with the [launch of the Express
products](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/06/29/168417.aspx),
I'm “Super-Excited”™ to announce the [Summer of Express
Contest](https://channel9.msdn.com/express/) on
[Channel9](https://channel9.msdn.com/)\!\!\!

It's time to break out the hot dogs and belt out some code as the good
folks at Channel9 our hosting the Summer of Express Contest\! All you
need to do is write code and you could win an Xbox, 1 year of Xbox Live,
and a copy of Halo 2\!  As the judge for C\# Express, I’m definitely
looking to see all the cool entries that you'll be
submitting\!\!
