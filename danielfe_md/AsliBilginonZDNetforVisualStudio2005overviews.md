Asli Bilgin, Microsoft developer evangelist and arguably one of the
nicest people at Microsoft, did a \[sponsored\] [whiteboard series on
ZDNet](http://news.zdnet.com/2036-11363_22-6044314.html). Asli was nice
enough to give me her lucky USB keychain after my [May CTP bad crash
lesson in TechEd Europe](/danielfe/archive/2004/07/06/174718.aspx). To
this day I carry the USB keychain in my laptop bag to provide me
better demo karma.

 good for teams, [watch and
learn](http://news.zdnet.com/2036-11363_22-6044314.html).
