I received an email today from admin @ Microsoft dotcom saying my
password has expired with a zip attachment indicating instructions.  Not
being gullible, but still being curious, I virus scanned the
attachment and saw that it was indeed a virus.  I forwarded the mail to
our security team for investigation, but it brings up a good point. 
Don't run attachments, patch your machines regularly and practice safe
computing.  My quick tips,

  - Don't believe everything you read in email. Not sure? Check
    [here](http://urbanlegends.com/ulz/) or
    [here](http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blxatoz.htm)
  - Don't run attachments if you don't know where they are coming from
  - Use and update your antivirus software
  - Use [Windows
    Update](http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/default.asp)
  - Use a firewall and block everything but the necessary ports.

There's also been some news about a vulnerability affecting DCOM which
lives inside the RPC process, with a patch available through [Windows
Update](http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/default.asp), which you
should visit if you don't have the RPC patch installed.

bulletin](http://www.microsoft.com/security/security_bulletins/ms03-026.asp)
