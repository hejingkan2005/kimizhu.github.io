I'm such a huge Bill Gates fan, not only for his technical and business
brilliance, but for all of the work his foundation has done. That's why
when [Jeff Sandquist](http://www.jeffsandquist.com/) and Charles Torre
told me I was going to be interviewing Bill, I was....beside myself. The
interview went well (in that I didn't pee my pants or kneel to kiss his
ring like some bad Italian mafia flick) and it was fascinating hearing
how Bill still prototypes code/APIs and how he's looking to do even more
coding on health and education applications for the foundation. The
other cool part is hearing Bill hint about how Access will now be a tool
for the Web. Many a developer has cut his teeth building Access
applications and seeing Access go beyond desktop applications is
**huge**. As for me, I'm on [cloud 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/) :)
