Kudos to Dale Dougherty, Phil Torrone, Dan Woods, Sherri Huss, Katie
Dougherty, Louise Glasgow, Bre Pettis and the rest of the O'Reilly team
for a "phenomenal" Maker Faire. The total attendance was a whopping
20,000+\!\! That's huge\! The thing that really struck out at me was the
sheer diversity of the attendees and their projects, from basket weaving
to clothing-refashioning ([Daryl

to robotics, to electronics to music and robo-art.  To paraphrase Dale's
words, "all of these different activities are tied together by the
inherent human need to create". Simple, yet deep, I like it :)

I also want to give a big thank you to Jacqueline Russell, Wendy
Harrison, and all the folks who worked the Microsoft pavilion. Special
shout out to [Ed Kaim](http://www.sharplogic.com/blogs/ed/) and
[team](http://www.sharplogic.com/coinfo/blogs.htm) for showing off some
very cool creations, including my favorite, the homemade [DDR
machine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/makerfaire/demos/default.aspx).

We had a big Microsoft presence, quarterbacked by Jacqueline and Wendy
that included Visual Studio Express, Coding4Fun, Media Center, Windows
Mobile, UMPC (read: Origami), Channel9, On10, and more.

My highlights:

  - Having [Tim O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/oreilly/tim_bio.html)
    bust a move on the [DDR
    machine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/makerfaire/demos/default.aspx)
  - Two words: [bug

  - [100 MPG Toyota

  - A [grease-powered Linux
    super-computer](http://www.danfernandez.com/images/greasepowered.jpg)
  - PocketPC powered creations like the [Finalizer
    Battlebot](http://www.danfernandez.com/images/battlebot.jpg) or a
    [PPC Robot](http://www.danfernandez.com/images/ppcpower.jpg)
  - Skype Home Automation

Scoble shows us some double love in his posts on [How to shut down

[Michael Lehman](/mglehman/) and [Charles
Torre](http://carmine.blogs.com/) from
[Channel9](https://channel9.msdn.com) as well as Laura Foy and [Duncan
Mackenzie](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/) from
[on10.net](http://www.on10.net) will have some good videos up soon with
cool demos. In fact [Laura's first video from Maker
Faire](http://on10.net/TheShow/2698/) is now up where she interviews
Dale Dougherty from Make Magazine. Duncan even has a blog post with
pictures of [Laura with a
flamethrower](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2006/04/24/4509.aspx) that
of course has been Photoshopped to [make on10.net

of [Maxwell](http://on10.net/people/maxwell/)).

Alas [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/), our trusty
Coding4Fun hardware guru couldn't make it...he would've had a blast\!

Maker Faire is by far the best and coolest conference I've ever gone to.
Hands down. My only complaint is having to work the booth and not being
able to walk around and play as much as I would've wanted to.
