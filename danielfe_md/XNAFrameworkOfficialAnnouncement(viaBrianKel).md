As I [previously blogged](/danielfe/archive/2006/03/15/552513.aspx),
it's now officially announced: The XNA Framework is a custom version of
the CLR and class libraries built to enable execution of managed code on
an Xbox 360 and Windows. At the Game Developer Conference, they are
showing games written in managed code running on the Xbox 360. Very
cool.

page](http://www.microsoft.com/xna/)
