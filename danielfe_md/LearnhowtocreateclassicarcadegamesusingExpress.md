The year was 1972, bell bottoms were all the rage, the US was in
Vietnam, The Price is Right premiered on CBS, the Dallas Cowboys had
just won Superbowl VI, the Godfather was the top grossing film, and on
November 29th, Atari released a game called Pong. With Pong and Atari,
the game industry was born.

33 years later, computer games are as popular as ever and since we all
have an "inner child" that loves gaming we recently released three new
Starter Kits, source code, documentation, and videos so you can learn
how to build your own game using Visual Studio Express.

The games are available in both VB and C\# and include:

  - Tiny Tennis (Pong
    clone) in [VB](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/gamedevelopment/tennisvb/default.aspx)
    or
    [C\#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/gamedevelopment/tenniscs/default.aspx)
  - Space Blitz (Space Invaders clone) in
    [VB](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/gamedevelopment/blitzvb/default.aspx)
    or
    [C\#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/gamedevelopment/blitzcs/default.aspx)
  - Crusader (2D Adventure game)
    in [VB](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/gamedevelopment/crusadervb/default.aspx)
    or
    [C\#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/gamedevelopment/crusadercs/default.aspx)

The games show the fundamental steps needed to create your own games
like a game loop, collision detection, movement, and more.
