published this article quoting James Gosling the creator of the Java
language where he says Microsoft's decision to support

.NET is one of the "biggest and most offensive mistakes that they could
have made".</span>*

Luckily, we have [Don Box to post a quick and eloquent
reply](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/02/06/5596.aspx)
