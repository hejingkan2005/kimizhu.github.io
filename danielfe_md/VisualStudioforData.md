I know I’m way late on this one, but it’s a great one, and that’s the
announcement of [Visual Studio Team Edition for Database
Professionals](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/products/dbpro/default.aspx).
One of the coolest things about Microsoft is seeing all the interesting
projects that are coming and actually being able to both beta test and
provide input to them at a really early stage. Back in February of 2005,
I made a post about “[My Dream SQL Tool
Features](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2005/02/10/370731.aspx)”
with a wish list of features that I wish our tools had including:

  - 
    
    <div>
    
    **DTS support for Importing XML**
    
    </div>

  - 
    
    <div>
    
    **Data Validation Rules**
    
    </div>

  - 
    
    <div>
    
    **Unit Test Support**
    
    </div>

  - 
    
    <div>
    
    **Refactoring**
    
    </div>

  - 
    
    <div>
    
    **FxCop**
    
    </div>

  - 
    
    <div>
    
    **Source Control for Stored Procs, Views, Triggers, Functions**
    
    </div>

I of course passed this onto the Data Dude team (internal name for the
SKU and the persona behind VS for DBs) as they were just starting to
staff the team. The good news is that [Unit
tests](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/images/teamsystem/products/dbpro/sc1.png),
[rename
refactoring](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/images/teamsystem/products/dbpro/sc3.png),
and Source control are all in the TechEd CTP (XML import in DTS is in
SQL 2005). Another great feature that I didn’t have on my list (but
really should have) is [dummy data
generation](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com//tsdatascreenshots/614020.aspx).
This is especially true when data is flowing to/from multiple systems.
The other one, which wasn’t an issue in the app I was creating, is the
deployment change management nightmare. How do I easily script changes
between Dev\>\>Test\>\>Staging\>\>Production? The answer is now that
it’s all automagically done for you\!
