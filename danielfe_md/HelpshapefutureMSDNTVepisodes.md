We're trying to put together a series of MSDN TV episodes to air once
every month on [Visual Studio
Whidbey](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx)
covering the things that developers would want to know in a particular
area.  **<span class="underline">My question to you is, what do you, as
a developer, want to know about Whidbey?</span>**  Below is a rough
draft of the topics I think would be good to cover: 

  - Visual C++
  - C\#
  - VB.NET
  - J\#
  - JLCA
  - MSBuild
  - Whitehorse
  - .NET Framework
  - ADO.NET
  - ObjectSpaces
  - ASP.NET
  - Windows Forms
  - ClickOnce

Please send me any feedback\!
