Do you still think .NET is “not yet?“  [Forrester
Research](http://www.forrester.com/) recently published a survey of 878
North American technology decision makers asking what their primary
development environment for 2004 will be: .NET or J2EE.

The answer: Overall, **the majority of respondents,** **56%, say .NET is
their primary development environment compared to 44% for J2EE**.  While
the numbers vary by industry, business services (64% .NET vs 36% J2EE)
and the public sector (66% .NET versus 35% J2EE) have an even more
pronounced .NET advantage.  This is pretty good considering we only
shipped two years ago :)

My personal opinion is that this research highlights the importance of
interoperability across platforms and how the industry should make
platform interop as painless as possible.  If I'm a developer, I should
at least know how to interoperate across platforms, but understanding
both platforms will make me a much more valuable asset to my company. If
you want to know how to get started interoperating across platforms, you
should read the [.NET and J2EE interoperability
guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/jdni.asp) that
PAG published or pick up a copy of Simon Guest's [.NET and J2EE
Interoperability
Toolkit](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619220/102-3513526-9890562?v=glance).
