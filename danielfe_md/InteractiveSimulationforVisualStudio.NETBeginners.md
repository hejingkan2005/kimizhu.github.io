With the launch of the [Java Developer Resource
Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/java/), we've added a new way for
developers who have never programmed using Visual Studio .NET before to
try without installing the product.  The simulations, created
by [Learnit
Corp](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/admin/www.learnitcorp.com),
 are ActiveX controls that provide a guided tour (with audio) through
creating your first XML Web service, Web application and Mobile Web
application.

These are for **<span class="underline">true</span>** beginners to
Visual Studio .NET, so experienced readers will think the content is too
simplistic, but I'd like to know what you think about the technology
medium, see questions below. 

**Why did we want to do this?  
**Everyone that tries Visual Studio .NET really thinks it's a superior
product from a developer productivity perspective.  The difficult part
is that before you can write your first “Hello World“ application, you
need to go through a long, potentially multi-gigabyte installation. Once
Visual Studio .NET is installed, a lot of time you don't even know where
to start and you can be a bit overwhelmed. In fact, we created a
[Getting Started
page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/java/gettingstarted/default.aspx)
for just this reason.  Since the interactive guide holds your hand
through the exercises, you'll know exactly what to do to get your first
application up and running.

**Questions for you**   
Do you like interactive simulations as a way to try out a new product?
Would you want more of these on deeper, more in-depth technology, or do
you prefer non-interactive videos a la MSDN TV?  If we did these for
Visual Studio 2005, what topics would you want us to cover?

Take them for a test drive

  - [Step 1: Build a Web
    Service](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/testdrive/webservice/)
  - [Step 2: Build an ASP.NET Web
    Application](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/testdrive/webapp/)
  - [Step 3: Build a Mobile Web
    Application](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/testdrive/mobile/)

**Step 1: Build Web Service**  
In step 1, you create an XML Web service that retrieves a list of
customers from the Customers table in the Northwind database.  Notice
that there are arrows and text (along with the audio) to guide
developers through creating the application.

**Step 2: Build an ASP.NET Web Application  
**In step 2, you add a reference to the XML Web service from step 1, and
bind the data from the Web service to a DataGrid.

**Step 3: Build a Mobile Web Application**

In the final step, you create a mobile Web application that calls
the Web service from step 1 and you see how Visual Studio will
intelligently render HTML and WML using Mobile Web controls.
