As most of you probably know, companies like Google, Yahoo, and MSN have
created their own Internet Explorer toolbars with added functionality. 
Besides integrated search, one of the most used features is blocking
pop-ups, an overdue feature for Internet Explorer.

My question to all of you is: ***How many pop-ups have you
blocked?***   
I recently rebuilt my machine, but I'm already up to 369 blocks.  [**Mr.
Keller**](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/) has over 1,100.  ***How many
do you have?*** 

Aside: Many of you are probably asking why doesn't IE have this, and the
good news is that it will with Windows XP SP2.  More details at Ars
Technica including screenshots on [**ICF
