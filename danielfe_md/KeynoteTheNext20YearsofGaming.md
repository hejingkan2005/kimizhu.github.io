Speaker: Ray Kurzweil

\[Aside: One of the best talks I've ever been to...ever\]

Rough notes below

**Acceleration of Progress**

  - Studying exponential growth of technology
  - Games are the cutting edge, VR will be more competitive
  - VR advantages - become someone else, Ray became 25 year-old female
    named Ramona

 

**Perspective of next several decades**

  - Study last several decades to make forward looking predictions
      - 1980's book, predictions tracked very well (Arpanet doubling)
      - Predicting world wide web connecting world
      - Chess supercomputer doubling power and beating machines
      - Decentralized electronic communication - effect on Russian
        totalitarian control
      - Democratizing tools of creativity - Kid in dorm room can build
        full HD video
  - What are the trends?
  - Became inventor at 5 years old - key is timing
  - Tools of production will also be democratized (Nano technology)
  - 1 billion fold increase in computation in the last 40 years
  - Another billion fold increase with same costs in next 25 years
  - Pea-size computer today
  - Apply 1B and 100K-fold size shrinking, expand intelligence, will be
    platelet size and AI inside your body..."but I'm getting ahead of
    myself"
  - Fat insulin receptor gene
      - Hold on to every calorie, hunting may be bad, we live in an area
        of abundance, obesity is the problem
          - What would happen if we turned gene off (RNA), rats 20%
            longer lives, thin
          - Companies rushing to bring to market for humans
          - Appetite suppressants - *Like a birth control pill that
            inhibits sex*
  - People make linear projections instead of exponential
      - Acceleration is so fast, things change radically in just a few
        years
  - 6/7 years ago, people didn't use search engines, blogs, podcasts,
    MMOs, social networks didn't exist

 

**Kurzweil Reading Machine**

  - Got started in 2002 for device that would be possible,
  - 5,000 times smaller, now the size of a cell phone
  - Takes a screenshot of a document, does real-time TTS

 

**Game Technology will be completely different**

  - Games becoming harbinger of technology

**Apply IT through energy**

  - nanotechnology
  - 19th century
  - New generation of nano-engineered solar panels, less expensive per
    watt for crossover
  - Is there enough sunlight?
  - Within 20 years to capture 1/10,000 of Sun fuels
  - V/C - Pet interest of Larry Paige
  - Doubling amount of solar energy every two years

**Paradigm Shift Rate is now doubling every decade**

  - Phone 50 years to be adopted
  - Countdown to singularity - theory of evolution
      - Life 1 Billion years
      - Biologic evolution accelerating
      - homo sapiens (100K years)
      - Technology builds on technology
          - Leads to technological evolution

**Exponential growth**

  - Looks very similar to linear when it starts, can even be sublinear,
    but growth is exponential
  - History of computation follows exponential growth
      - Vacuum tubes exponential growth did end
      - Transistors took over to exponential growth will end by \~2020,
        transistors are 2D only
          - Switch to 3D chips, multilayer circuits, Intel is
            prototyping 3D
  - Despite unpredictable history (world wars, depression, etc),
    technological advances stayed on exponential growth

 

**Transistor Price**

  - Logarithmic decrease in transistor price, cost of transistor cycle
    gone down by half 1.1 years, massive deflation through technology
  - Tech deflation helps drive lack of economy inflation

10 years for first billion, 3 years for next billion

 

DNA sequencing - Govt program (15 years) - 1% in first 7 years is
correct growth as exponential growth will hit 100%

Respirocyte - releasing oxygen in blood cell, could sit in bottom of
pool for four hours

**"Creepy valley"** - Really intelligent, but not all there, will seem
like demented humans

A complex system can't be so complex as to understand itself - Not what
we're seeing

  - Seven of the dozen separate movies that the eye extracts from a
    scene and sends to the brain (7 low res images)

Within 20 years, be able to model and simulate all parts of the human
brain

  - Simulate human intelligence

Exponential progression

  - B2B and B2C growing exponential (would be 5/6th largest country)
  - 2 trillion dollars on Internet

\[aside Question: How does Microsoft stack in terms of exponential
growth?  Do our products/adoption follow this curve? \]

 

Video of a real-time translator for cell phones, within a few years, we
will be able to talk to anyone regardless of their language.

 

**2010 - Computers disappear**

  - Images written directly to our retinas
  - Ubiquitous high bandwidth connection to the the Internet at all
    times
  - tiny electronics that can be embedded
  - Interaction with virtual personalities as a primary interface
  - Effective language technologies

**2029: Predictions**

  - Reverse engineering of the human brain
  - Computers can pass the Turing test
  - $1,000 of comp = 1K times the human brain
  - Enhances human, not evil robots
  - non-bio intelligence will continue to grow exponentially whereas
    biological intelligence is effectively fixed
      - Don't stay within confines of biology
  - 15 years from now will be adding a year every year to human life
