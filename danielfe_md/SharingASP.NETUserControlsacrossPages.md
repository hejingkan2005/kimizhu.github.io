We recently published a How-To on
[support.microsoft.com](http://support.microsoft.com) for how to share
user controls across projects.  In talking with customers, one of the
things they would like to do is have a common set of reusable web UI,
say a navigation bar, across multiple Visual Studio projects.  The
problem is that there hasn't been an easy way to do this, and creating a
server control seems like a lot of work for something so simple.  To
help make this easier,
[this article](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q324785) gives
step-by-step instructions for creating a virtual directory for common
user controls that can be reused in multiple Visual Studio projects.
