[Wired magazine](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,61150,00.html)
points out how [Friendster](http://www.friendster.com) isn't so
friendly and how lots of people are migrating over to
[Emode](http://www.emode.com/) or [Tribe](http://www.tribe.net).  I
haven't tried eMode, but Tribe is nice if nothing more then the
geographic tie-in... 

I'd love to see Friendster get a web service where I can poll for my
friends pictures, or an RSS feed for the message board...  
  
Maybe [Enemyster](http://www.enemyster.com) will finally come out of
private Beta
