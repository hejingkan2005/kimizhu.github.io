A new set of [Express Community Tech
Preview](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/get/default.aspx#express)
(CTP) SKUs are now available for download. Besides new features which
may or may not be stable, we also have a new product activation model
where you can use Express for 30 days without having to register. After
30 days you'll need to register Express to continue using it.

I'll speak more about registration later
