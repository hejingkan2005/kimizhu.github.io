While in a co-worker's office discussing the merits (or lack therof) of
the word "blog", [Googlism](http://www.googlism.com) came up in
conversation. Googlism searches [Google](http://www.google.com) and
based on the results, creates a meta-description for who you are, when
something took place, or what something is.  
For example, searching for "Brian Goldfarb" returns this gem *"brian
goldfarb is one of those young people who knows where the information
is"*.  
Searching for my name, I discover that: *"dan fernandez is definitely
marrying sexy star sheila ysrael at the end of this month"*.  
Ack, don't tell the Mrs., she may not be happy :) If you get some funny
Googlism hits, send them my way\!
