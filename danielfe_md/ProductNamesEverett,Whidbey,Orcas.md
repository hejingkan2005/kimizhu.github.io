I got a question from someone recently asking what the naming convention
we have been using for Visual Studio represents.  Is Orcas a character
in Lord of the Rings? Answer: No.  Here's the real answer: The versions
of Visual Studio represent cities/islands in the Northwest that are
progressively farther away from Redmond, WA.

  - Visual Studio .NET 2003: Codenamed
    [Everett](http://www.everettwa.org/) is on the mainland 
  - Visual Studio "[Whidbey](http://www.whidbey.net/islandco/)" is an
    island a little farther away
  - Visual Studio "[Orcas](http://www.orcasisland.org/)" is also an
    island farther away then Whidbey. 

For more information on what's coming in Whidbey and Orcas, check out

Roadmap](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx) or
