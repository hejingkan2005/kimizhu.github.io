﻿In an on-going effort to ensure that Channel 9 videos only display
appropriate content, the Channel 9 Dev Team recently ported the [spam
feature](https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=394267) to
filter existing **video** content.  
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the results of our first tests
using some of the more popular C9 video clips. The video filter should
be complete by the time we ship Channel 9 V4.  
   
Congratulations to the dev team and to [JKL
consulting](http://abc.go.com/latenight/jimmykimmel/index?pn=index) for
creating the original video filter prototype.  

 Here's a quick 3-minute video of the filter in action.
