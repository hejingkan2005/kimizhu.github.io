Still catching up on old email, but I did want to post that Windows
Developer Power Tools was published last Friday, congrats to Jim Holmes
and James Avery on pulling together a great collection of tools (170+
and over 1,300 pages). I personally authored the Visual Studio Express
Chapter so I guess I can consider myself a writer now, and frankly I'm
in good company in the book with Rob Howard, Sara Ford, Adam Nathan, and
many others contributing.  James has a blog entry to [wet your appetite
on some of the
tools](http://dotavery.com/blog/archive/2007/01/12/30166.aspx), you can check
out a [sample chapter on O'Reilly
Books](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596527549/), [read an
interview with Jim and
James](http://www.oreillynet.com/windows/blog/2007/01/an_interview_with_jim_holmes_a.html)
and of course order through
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Developer-Power-Tools-Turbocharge/dp/0596527543).
