I would love to have high-speed wireless access on an airplane, and,
assuming it was a transatlantic flight, I would be willing to pay up to
$50 for it.  I love that [Singapore
Airlines](http://www.singaporeair.com) is adding [WiFi
support](http://rss.com.com/2100-7351_3-5105736.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news). 
Now all I need is a reason to visit Singapore, maybe I should go to see
