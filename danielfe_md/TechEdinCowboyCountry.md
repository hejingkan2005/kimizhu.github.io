Next week is TechEd and I'm really excited and just a bit
overwhelmed.  I was also a little afraid of going into Cowboy country
as I used to call the DC area home and I'm a Redskins fan, but luckily
there are a fair number of us current and former Redskins both
presenting and attending.  I also used to live in Austin (loved it
thanks for asking) and people from Texas are really friendly so I'm not
too scared.  We have a ton of stuff going on for developers and I always
find the toughest part being choosing what sessions to attend.  So
without further ado, here are my pics for sessions and events:

**Can't Miss C\# Sessions:**

  - Extreme Programming with C\# - [Ken
    Schwaber](http://www.cutter.com/consultants/schwaberk.html)
  - C\# Past, Present, and Future - (Me) 
  - C\# Best Practices - [Eric
    Gunnerson](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/csharp/team/ericgu/default.aspx)
    and [Juval
    Lowy](http://www.microsoftregionaldirectors.com/Extranet/DirectorDetails.aspx?did=1146)
  - Best Practices for Debugging Visual Studio - Habib Heydarian
  - Building Middle-Tier Applications in C\# - (Me)

**Other Cool Events:**

  - We're organizing a [TechEd Bloggers](http://www.techedbloggers.net)
    meeting on Monday night from 7-8PM in room 118A.  If you blog and
    you're attending TechEd, come join the fun and/or the after party\! 
    We may also be able to get a blogging room with wireless access so
    keep [checking](http://www.techedbloggers.net) for updates...
  - Come Hang with the C\# team on Wednesday night from 7-8pm in room
    118A. We'll probably go out for drinks this night too...
  - We're also presenting to the Dallas .NET User Group Thursday
    night from 6-9pm at the Microsoft office. Click [here](%3Ca) for
    directions, and the official TechEd party is this night, so join-in
    and have fun.
  - While this isn't really a cool event per se, the [Hands-on
    labs](http://www.mymsevents.com/MyMSEvents/Content.Aspx?p=HOL.htm)
    are IMHO the best way to learn .NET concepts you might not be
    familiar with. 

**Other Interesting Sessions I'll hit:**

  - Speech-enabled web applications - Richard Irving, Siddharth Bhatia
  - Developing InfoPath Solutions Part 1 and 2 - Adriana Ardeleanu
  - .NET and J2EE Strategies for Interoperability - Simon Guest
  - Strategies for J2EE Developers - [David
    Weller](http://www.inkblog.com)
  - Word XML: The Word XML Schema - Brian Jones
  - A first look at the Microsoft Location Server - Steve Lombardi

My schedule is also chock full of customer meetings so I sadly won't be
able to attend as many sessions as I would like.  What sessions are you
planning to attend? Did I miss \*your\* cool event? Let me know\!
