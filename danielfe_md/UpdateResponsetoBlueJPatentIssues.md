\* Update: fixed wrong hyperlink 

On Friday, an alert reader emailed me about a [new article by Michael
K*ö*lling](http://www.bluej.org/mrt/?p=21), the creator of BlueJ, about
a patent issued by Microsoft for features in Object Test Bench that are
comparable to BlueJ's Object Bench. I'll post the full "anatomy of a
firedrill" some time later, but for now we can officially say that the
**patent application was a mistake and one that should not have
happened. To fix this, Microsoft will be removing the patent application
in question**. Our sincere apologies to Michael Kölling and the BlueJ
community.

In addition, our Product Unit Manager is investigating how this happened
to begin...Again my apologies to Michael, but I'm glad in the end we did
the right thing.
