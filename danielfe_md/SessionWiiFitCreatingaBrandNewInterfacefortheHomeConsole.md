Wii Fit Package Contents

\- Balance Board and software

 

Not born of strategic process,

Please don't post photos (women right next to me took a picture)

Party Play

Wii Sports -

In the center is a section called "Health Pack"

\- Became Wiifit, was at the center of the slide, plans for original Wii

\-  body management, health, calorie control, scale

My Miyamoto: "I have fun just weighing myself and collecting my weight
data, so this idea is bound to lead to something interesting"

\- "Developers must always approach their projects with the belief they
are developing a million seller"

\- Develop a cost-effective scale

  - Start from scratch rather than reuse existing (needs to be more than
    a scale)
  - rotary encoder stick from N-64 controller, minimal friction and
    great precision

Something wasn't quite right, fear/doubt of project

Japan's National Sport: Sumo

  - Sumo wrestler's need two scales to measure "aha moment"
  - Sample 60x per second
  - Part of the body test was balance
  - Show how to visually show how weight is transferred from left/right
    side
  - Heart of the weight detector is a rotary encoder
  - Rumble: Rumble for your legs - just not enough power and would kill
    battery
  - Foot controller: Should it detect forward and backward shifts? Devs
    said left/right was fine, but still wanted.

Checked Nintendo Service Center (returns)

  - How do you keep costs low and keep it simple so that you don't
    balloon servicing cost

 

Strain gauge to measure difference and force. Wiifit ships with 4
sensors

Multiple revisions to incorporate a number of factors

  - Make it wider, shoulder width
  - larger also means higher cost
  - build it so that tall/short people can play and have it work
    worldwide

 

  - President review feedback: It's clumsy to plug in a wiimote
  - Radio interference,

 

WiiFit - Body test features

WiiFit Channel - Add Wiifit bodytest as a channel (so you don't need the
disk)
