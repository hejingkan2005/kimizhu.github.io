**Lightswitch Shift:** A unit of measurement for how long your workday
is, defined as at least 14 hours. The terminology comes from buildings
in the Redmond campus which use energy saving features whereby office
lights will automatically go off between 9pm and 7am.  A lightswitch
shift refers to an employee that started the work day before 7am and
stays past 9pm because during that time employees must go outside their
office and hit a main lightswitch to re-enable their office lights to
turn on and stay on in increments of two hours.

 

Use:

Employee 1:  *I've been working lightswitch shifts for the last two
weeks getting our projects completed.*

Employee 2: *Pwned.*
