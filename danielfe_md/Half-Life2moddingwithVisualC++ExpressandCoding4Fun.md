\* Updated: Wanted to include a link to MS Research lecture on using the
[Half Life 2 Game Engine in
Academia](http://research.microsoft.com/workshops/FS2005/webcasts/12536/lecture.htm)

Question: What do you get when you combine what's been described as "The
Best Game Ever Made" (Half-Life 2) and Visual Studio?   
Answer: Pure Joy  

[Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/), my rock star
partner-in-crime for [Visual Studio
Express](http://msdn.microsoft.com/express/), officially announced at
TechEd Australia how Microsoft and [Valve
Software](http://www.valve.com/) (makers of
[Half-Life 2](http://www.half-life2.com/)) are working together in
TechEd Australia yesterday. From the [joint press
release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/aug05/08-31ValveCPlusPlusPR.mspx):

*Today at Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Tech•Ed Australia, Microsoft Corp.
announced that Valve Corp.<sup>®</sup>, creator of award-winning game
franchises “Half-Life<sup>®”</sup> and “Counter-Strike<sup>TM</sup>,”
has named the upcoming Microsoft Visual C++<sup>®</sup> 2005 Express
Edition as the preferred development environment for hobbyist
Windows<sup>®</sup> developers creating modifications for
Source<sup>TM</sup>, the engine on which “Half-Life 2” is built. In
addition, during Tech•Ed Australia, attendees will get to hear how Team
Dystopia created its modification for “Half-Life 2” with Visual C++.*

[Team Dystopia](http://www.dystopia-game.com/), makers of a Cyberpunk
Half-Life 2 mod gave five presentations on modding Half Life 2 at TechEd
Australias. Here's a picture of [the team at
TechEd](http://dystopia-game.com/tmp/IMG_4664.JPG).

Not only that, to help support Half-Life 2 modders, we also launched the
[Half-Life 2 Mod Spot on
Coding4Fun](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/half-life/default.aspx)\!

If you've never heard of [Half-Life 2](http://www.half-life2.com/), they
are literally the **\#1 PC Game of all time** on
[MetaCritic](http://www.metacritic.com/). Here are just a couple of the
glowing reviews: 

  - *This game is so close to flawless it's painful to the eye. It's so
    beautifully constructed, so immaculate, I can barely bring myself to
    divulge its details...Simply the most essential gaming experience of
    the year, the game the entire FPS genre has been building towards
    for the past decade, and one of the defining moments of the
    videogame medium as a whole.  
    *- [Computer and Video
    Games](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/reviews/reviews_story.php?id=111902)
    **
  - *No other game does as many things as well as Half-Life 2; I had so
    much fun that I can forgive the game its abysmal ending. I was
    continually enthralled and amazed.  
    *- [New York
    Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/25/technology/circuits/25game.html?ex=1102400752&ei=1&en=e3a5cf6f48defd10)
  - *History in the making. It raises the bar for interactive
    entertainment, and then uses that bar to club all other games into
    submission...Valve has forged the framework for the next generation
    of games, demonstrating what our medium can and should be able to
    accomplish - an exhilarating entertainment that can emotionally move
    you one moment, kick ass the next, and keep you immersed the whole
    time.  
    *- PC Gamer \[Dec 2004, p48\]
  - *Half-Life 2 hits the ground running and never stops, and playing it
    for long periods of time can actually be exhausting. Just when you
    think you've seen the coolest thing it has to throw at you, the next
    sequence tops it.
