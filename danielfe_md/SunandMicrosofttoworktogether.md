*Sun and Microsoft reach a deal on antitrust and patent issues, with
payments of $1.95 billion set to go to Sun, which also announced that it
will cut 3,300 jobs as losses mount.*

*Under the 10-year pact with Microsoft, the software company will pay
Sun $700 million to resolve antitrust issues and $900 million to resolve
patent issues, the companies said. The companies will pay royalties to
use each other's technology; Microsoft is paying $350 million now, with
Sun to make payments when it incorporates technology later.*

*The ten-year technical collaboration will encompass several facets,
designed to improve information sharing between the companies’ server
and desktop products.*

Here's my quick assessment of how we can collaborate:

  - Liberty & Passport
  - .NET & Java
  - “Windows desktop communication protocols” (whatever that means)
  - [MS JVM support](http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/java/)

  It's a new era in computing, everyone's growing up and learning to
play nicely.
