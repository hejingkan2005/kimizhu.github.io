Today is George Conard's last day at Microsoft :(

George is/was a Program Manager on the C\# team who was responsible for
several things including Whidbey planning (where I worked with him
closely) and academia.  He will be missed, but the good news is that he
has started [blogging](http://www.georgeconard.com/blog/), so we'll be
able to follow his adventures wherever they take him.
