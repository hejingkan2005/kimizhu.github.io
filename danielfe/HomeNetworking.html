    <p>
        I&#160;somehow managed to have both a relaxing and busy Memorial day&#160;weekend
        as my "Mrs." was in town and she helped me finish unpacking all of my junk.&#160;
        I also finally got around to setting up my wireless network.&#160; My apartment complex
        has a T1 line which residents access through a DSL modem and it only costs $50! Sadly,
        you can't host sites, but at least there are tools like <a href="http://www.dyndns.com/">Dynamic
        DNS</a> and <a href="http://www.no-ip.com/">No-IP</a> for those of you using DHCP
        through a Cable modem or DSL. For those of you looking to set this up at home, here's
        my current setup - I use a Microsoft Brand <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/broadbandnetworking/wirelessbasestation.aspx">MN-500
        Wireless Router</a> . This has built in Network Address Translation so while the router
        receives a single IP address from my ISP, internally I can hook up as many machines
        as I want to the network using a Class C subnet.&#160; You can also setup port forwarding
        for other services you might want to use like FTP, WWW, SMTP, POP3, Quake etc. Other
        cool features include the ability to "backup" your config, block pings, an easy-to-use
        admin page&#160;and it even has a built-in firewall. Not bad for a product that costs
        &lt;$100. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size=+1><b>But,</b></font> the home networking madness doesn't stop there, I
        also&#160;use a Linksys <a href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=432&amp;grid=">WET11
        Bridge</a> which lets me have a dynamic IP address from my Wireless access point to
        my living room. So that 100' CAT-5 cable snaking from the office is gone and the "Mrs."
        is happy :) &lt;br&gt; 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're having problems connecting your Xbox using the WET11 bridge, I stumbled
        on <a href="http://linksys.com/splash/wetxbox.asp">this page</a> on the Linksys web
        site which explains step-by-step how to configure the bridge for playing Xbox Live.
        Since we're on the topic of 802.11, I thought I would share some of my favorite wireless
        sights: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://80211hotspots.com/">802.11 Hotspots</a> - Find wireless connections
            anywhere in the <b>world</b>. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.netstumbler.com">Net Stumbler</a> - This site has a good shop
            for all your wireless networking gear&#160;needs (although it doesn't have the MN-500),
            and it's also where you can download netstumbler, one of my favorite apps for finding
            wireless networks, which now even includes an add-in for mapping hotspots using MapPoint.
            The nice thing about NetStumbler is that it searches multiple channels and not just&#160;your
            default wireless card channels.&#160;&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.warchalking.org/">Warchalking</a> - When you get your wireless
            network up and running, don't forget how&#160;you can covertly notify those of us
            in the wireless digerati. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://tech.msn.com/internet/speedtest.asp">Bandwidth Speed Test</a> - Once
            you have your connection up and running, see how fast your network *really* works.
            My bandwidth report on my home network was ~700Kbps which I thought was good until
            I just now ran this same test at work and got a stunning <b><i>2,386 kbps</i></b> of
            real throughput through my wireless (WEP-enabled) connection!!<br />
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        That's all for now, enjoy, 
    </p>
