        Reading <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/PermaLink.aspx/14b5442d-097f-4261-b683-11cb2e63321d">Korby's </a>blog
        today, I saw that Microsoft recently updated their <a href="http://search.microsoft.com/search/search.aspx?view=en-us&amp;st=b">search
        page</a> and you can now successfully enter "C#" and find C#!&#160; What *<em>used</em>*
        to happen is that the "#" symbol got ignored and a search for "C# samples" returned
        "C samples".&#160; BIG thanks to the MS search team for making this happen!&#160;
        I originally noticed this before I took the job as&#160;the C# Product Manager, and
        as it turns out I wasn't the only person who was aware of this flaw.&#160; When C#
        was originally mentioned on MS websites (circa 2000), Tony, the C# Product&#160;Manager
        at the time, &#160;noticed that MS search didn't allow for the "#" symbol and e-mailed
        the search team.&#160; Per Tony, they responded by saying we should rename the language,
        and Tony responded with a classic <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/briankel/PermaLink.aspx/28384afc-6509-450b-a7be-8e6ec631e56a">Goodhew-ism</a>,
        which I won't repeat but it involved Tony pointing out, in only the blatantly obvious
        way that Tony can, that&#160;the search engine should be able to&#160;support&#160;a
        character&#160;in the <a href="http://www.jimprice.com/jim-asc.htm">8-bit ASCII</a> set,
        which has been around since the 60's.&#160; Tony rules. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After hearing this, I set my 2-year personal mission to be able to search for "C#"
        on Microsoft.com.&#160; About the only thing I actually did to accomplish this goal
        was to&#160;mention this to <a href="http://http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/saraw/">Sara
        Williams</a>, who informed me that search was being revamped.&#160; I'm not sure if
        Sara did anything, but she totally understood, and also explained to me that MSDN
        is dependent on the general MS search, so there wasn't much she could do.&#160; I
        definitely got to give her credit though :)

        On a side note, the "#" symbol, commonly referred to as the pound or hash&#160;symbol
        is technically known as the <a href="http://www.quinion.com/words/weirdwords/ww-oct1.htm">octothorpe</a>.
        The quick explanation of the octothorpe is included below:
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>The story as told by Ralph Carlsen is that a Bell Labs engineer, Don Macpherson,
        went to instruct their first client, the Mayo Clinic, in the use of the new system.
        He felt the need for a fresh and unambiguous name for the # symbol. His reasoning
        that led to the new word was roughly that it had eight points, so ought to start with
        octoâ€“. He was apparently at that time active in a group that was trying to get the
        Olympic medals of the athlete Jim Thorpe returned from Sweden, so he decided to add
        thorpe to the end.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        &#160; The "#" symbol in "C#" is <u><strong>not</strong></u> an octothorpe, but instead
        the&#160;musical note C#.&#160;For simplicity, this is expressed as&#160;the "#" symbol.&#160;
        Another theory that I've heard is that the&#160;# symbol is a combination of&#160;&#160;the&#160;"++"
        in&#160;C++, with the&#160;"+" symbols&#160;crossed over each other&#160;to form the
        # symbol. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Other&#160;sites I regularly use&#160;that don't support "C#"
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Some parts of Amazon.com</li>
        <li>
            BlogX&#160;for category names, which is a while back why I added the phonetic spelling
            of C# and stopped using the "C#" category</li>
    </ul>
