<p><font face=Arial size=2>I love <a href="http://www.familyguy.com/">Family Guy</a>. Its&nbsp;arguably my favorite TV show right now and its simply brilliant (The Daily Show with John Stewart is a very close second). On any given show, you'll find references to&nbsp;old school TV hits, pop culture icons, and things out of left field that remind me of the Simpsons around season 2 &amp; 3, but with a bit more edge. If you're a Family Guy fan, you should definitely visit </font><a href="http://www.familyguyfiles.com"><font face=Arial size=2>FamilyGuyFiles.com </font></a><font face=Arial size=2>which has a pretty all-encompassing list of Family Guy references. </font></p>
<p><font face=Arial size=2>One of my favorite references is&nbsp;the reference to the "Peanut Butter Jelly Time" Internet meme&nbsp;circa 2002. And by favorite I mean I've had the damn PBJ Time song stuck in my head for weeks&nbsp;continously replaying in a background thread in my brain until I simply give up and become a host who's sole purpose is to propagate it unto others like a </font><a href="http://www.theringworld.com/ringvirus.php"><font face=Arial size=2>ring virus</font></a><font face=Arial size=2>.&nbsp; With that, I hope that blogging this will finally get this song-virus out of my head :)</font></p>
