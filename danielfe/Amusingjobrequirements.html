<div id='content'><p>Edit: Our CRM team says this job posting doesn't belong to them</p> <p>I got sent this recently from a Microsoft SDE position&nbsp;(Job ID: 124984)</p> <p><em><strong>....The candidate must have 4+ years of commercial development experience in following areas: .NET Framework, ASP.NET</strong>/ASP<strong>,</strong> Advanced Web Services, <strong>WSE</strong>, TSQL, <strong>C#,</strong> C++, SQL Server/database technologies, multithreading techniques, system software development (scalable and reliable), algorithms, and performance analysis....</em></p> <p>I'm not sure who writes these "requirements", but when I read this I assume that must have skills really mean "<u>must have</u>". Let's check history:</p> <p>The .NET Framework 1.0 released in February 2002. That means by next month the most commercial .NET Framework/ASP.NET/C# experience you could have is three years. 4+ years commercial experience just put everyone out of that loop. Or how about WSE?&nbsp;WSE SP1 wasn't released until March 2003. </p> <p>So much for common sense. One of my other favorite job "requirements" was J2EE jobs that listed "three years experience using Enterprise Jelly Beans." Luckily, I really shine in the jelly bean space. </p></div>
