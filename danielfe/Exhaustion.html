<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Exhaustion</STRONG><BR>I'm physically exhausted from work and continuous sleep deprivation...you know it's bad when you hit 40 hours a week in three days (including Sunday).&nbsp; This job isn't a sprint, it's a marathon, and I'm the sucker looking for the next runner to give the baton to, and I'm barefoot, running on hot coals, wearing an itchy wool sweater, and panting like a pre-teen at&nbsp;an&nbsp;NSync concert.&nbsp;You probably want to know what's keeping me up at night..there are a bunch of upcoming exec reviews for VS '05 and they require a&nbsp;tremendous amount of work and coordination.&nbsp;I have a backlog of Pri 1 tasks I simply don't have time to do, and I only blog to escape the <FONT color=#ff0000>horror </FONT>of my reality.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><STRONG>Fighting for what you believe in</STRONG><BR>My other problem is that I passionately believe in a product decision and I'm &#8220;<EM>going to the mat</EM>&#8221; as <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joen/">Joe</A> would say to try and defend it.&nbsp; It's a losing battle right now&nbsp;and I don't think I'll be able to stop the train (it'll run right over me), but I have to try.&nbsp; At Microsoft you definitely need to pick your battles, because you can't have *everything*.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes though, you just need to fight&nbsp;a fight because it's what you believe in, no matter how&nbsp;badly the odds are stacked against you. That's me, right now, 8:02PM PST in my office, no dinner, no sleep and over 400 pages of PowerPoint slide decks in front of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully this post will make sense sometime&nbsp;at the end of this year, but&nbsp;I'll let you know if I'm even standing&nbsp;next&nbsp;Friday :).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In the chaos of&nbsp;discussing how busy we were today, <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bgold/">Goldfarb</A> made me cackle out loud&nbsp;with this quote &#8220;<EM>I need to S+ a&nbsp;1:1 with God to&nbsp;talk about extending the work day</EM>&#8221;. Maybe you have to work&nbsp;@ MS, but I thought&nbsp;that was hilarious, but then again it's probably just sleep deprivation.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
