        "Work hard, play hard" is my mantra (and the mantra of most people at MS), but it's
        pretty damn exhausting after a while. I haven't been able to blog since last week,
        and it's simply because I've been busy *<strong>all*</strong> the time. This weekend,
        for example, I went back home to DC for a friend's wedding, and didn't go to sleep
        before 5am any day there, and every second I was awake I was busy. I had a great time,
        but it was exhausting. 
        <br />
        I arrived back in Seattle on Sunday night to read 150+ emails (no joke) before going
        to sleep around 2am. On Monday, I worked until 7pm and then ran over to play in my
        <a href="http://www.arenasports.net/index.php?sw_tab=2&&sw_ltab=a&&action=hockey/index">roller hockey league's</a> All-Star game. I just joined this league (thanks to <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/edkaim">EdKaim</a>),
        being a newcomer to Seattle and all, and it's been a lot of fun so far. Our team won
        the All-Star game 8-6, and I assisted on three goals in the effort. Woohoo! After
        the game I got home at about 9:30pm, ordered dinner and started working again. By
        the time I caught up on email it was 2am. A solid six hours of sleep and I was back
        to work. I have a hockey game tonight too, and I won't get back home until about 12:30am,
        exhausted, hungry, and ready to pass out. I'll get to sleep by 2am, and six hours
        later I'll be getting up&#160;for work.&#160; Caffeine is my friend, and these <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993851">mad
        scientists</a> must be stopped&lt;g&gt;.

        <b>My Hockey History</b> 
        <br />
        I've been playing hockey for a while, starting with street hockey with friends in
        neighborhood tennis courts and cul-de-sacs to roller hockey in the now defunct SESARA
        out of Wheaton Ice rink, playing in the 18 and over league when I was a scrawny, underweight
        17 year old. I then played and ran the <a href="http://www.miami.edu">Univ. of Miami</a> roller
        hockey <a href="http://www.miami.edu/wellness-clubs/roller_hockey/about_us.htm">club</a> league.
        As a geek, I created a scoring and scheduling system for the league built in Access,
        and had player and team statistical reports exported to our school's web site. I also
        played for Miami's team in what is now the <a href="http://www.crhl.net">CRHL</a>.
        In the summers both during and after college I played in SESARA which became the <a href="http://www.thegardensicehouse.com/hockey/inline_league.htm">Gardens
        Ice House</a> league playing for the good old Washington Whale, (the team I had started
        with as a 17 year old but at that time was called the Fighting Ferrets) and also started
        playing for the <a href="http://www.chargershockey.com">Chargers</a> in both ice and
        roller hockey. Good times! I'll have to bring my hockey gear next time I visit DC
        to get my game on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft has a charity&#160;<a href="http://www.mshockeychallenge.com/default.asp">ice
        hockey team</a> that regularly beats Sun, Apple and other tech companies&#160;but
        my dream is to some day play on the team that beats them on wheels.<br />
        <br />
        I definitely prefer playing roller hockey to exercising in a gym. There's something
        very gerbil-esque about using a treadmill or a stairmaster that I can't seem to get
        past. I also can't seem to get past the lack of accomplishment or completion one feels
        by picking up a heavy object 12 times only to put it back down again. I must be missing
        something :)

        &#160;Work hard, play hard, when does one&#160;find the&#160;time to <i><b>rest</b></i> hard?
