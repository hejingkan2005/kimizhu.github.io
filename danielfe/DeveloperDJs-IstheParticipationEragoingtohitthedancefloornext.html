<div id='content'><p>No, this isn't about <a href="http://dev.live.com">coding for live</a>, but rather a relatively new movement called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding">Live coding</a> where DJs&nbsp;both <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71248-0.html?tw=wn_index_1">mix and code&nbsp;during a&nbsp;live performance</a>. As regular blog readers know, I'm a fan of Developer DJ's like <a href="http://www.djbolivia.ca/">DJ Bolivia</a> who has some <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2006/03/13/550975.aspx">great mixes for when you're coding.</a> </p> <p>There's even a concurrent programming language, ChucK,&nbsp;for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChucK">real-time audio synthesis</a>.</p> <p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Live Media Stream Editing<br></strong>I'd love to see this taken to the next level where a DJ could easily edit/manipulate a live video stream of interesting images and video, say using XAML in real-time and have the UI actually change and react to the current tempo/bass of the music. </p> <p>So what the hell does this mean for your regular night out clubbing? </p> <p><strong>The Participation Era and the Dance Floor<br></strong>I'd also love to see a way where both the music and media stream editing can change and react based on users behavior. While DJs do a great job of understanding and buiding the general vibe of a club, the concept of particpation in both music and media. Imagine a dance club with heat maps, pressure and motion sensors that can react and change the music based on real-time interaction with the crowd. All you have to do is dance and the software will recognize the mood of the dance club. Second, imagine being able to send real-time pictures to that live video stream at any time and have the DJ remix your experience live...</p> <p>Too geeky? Technology for the future? maybe, but becoming a co-DJ without even knowing it (no hardware, just a specially designed dance floor) is an interesting if not amusing possibility</p></div>
