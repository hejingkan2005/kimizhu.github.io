<div id='content'><p>Tony Goodhew talks about <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=24709">Visual Studio "Orcas"</a>&nbsp;(the version after VS 2005) on Channel9. I only wish Tony voice was my inner voice. Brian Keller and I wish Tony would lend his vocal chords for everything from Airport flight arrival announcements to cell phone answering messages.</p> <p><em>"Right, so flight 254 from Houston has arrived at Gate D9. As part of the 9th circuit court of appeals, I must advise you that your luggage will be on carousel numbah two."</em></p> <p><em>"Right, so Dan isn't hear to take a call,&nbsp;but leave a message,&nbsp;he won't call you back, but you'll feel bettah"</em>&nbsp;</p> <p>Tony rocks :)</p></div>
