<P>If you didn't hear (<A href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1979586,00.asp">eWeek</A>, <A href="http://internet.itbusinessnet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=46827">StreetInsider</A>, <A href="http://internet.itbusinessnet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=46827">ITBusinessNet</A>, <A href="http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/topnews/wpn-60-20060621MicrosoftBringsToolsToCareerBuilder.html">WebProNews</A>) Microsoft and CareerBuilder recently announced a new partnership aimed at helping Visual Studio developers find jobs through a <A href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/express/">new portal</A>&nbsp;with links to .NET jobs, salaries, and even learning content for job switchers. <STRONG>I love this</STRONG>, many props to Doug, <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/christ/">Chris</A> and everyone that helped make this happen.&nbsp;My personal&nbsp;opinion is that technology companies need to do a much better job of increasing&nbsp;their&nbsp;customers skills and in making sure they&nbsp;are&nbsp; aware of the career opportunities available to them.&nbsp;Why? Because&nbsp;technology&nbsp;choice is more than a logical exericse, there's an emotional aspect that is&nbsp;way too often ignored and underserved.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we can help Microsoft developers be employed better than other vendor, we win.&nbsp;I'm definitely excited&nbsp;on how we could even expand this to help employ Micosoft DBA's and System Administrators.</P>
<P>If you have other suggestions for how we can help customers be a better partner in your career, let us know. </P>
