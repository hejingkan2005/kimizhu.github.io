<div id='content'><p>&lt;PersonalRant&gt;</p> <p>There was a lot of <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bclteam/archive/2005/01/21/358484.aspx">good sessions</a> and fighting for too few spots&nbsp;TechEd this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was brutal, and I mean <font color="#ff0000">brutal</font>. There were hundreds of recommendations, fewer total session spots then last year, a new security track, VSTS sessions,&nbsp;and a Business Applications (MS CRM) track. About 90% of all session recommendations were cut. Ouch!</p> <p>Bottom line, there are only <strong>two dedicated C# sessions</strong> this year. I&nbsp;tried, I really, *really* did.&nbsp;We had more last year, and they were all&nbsp;very&nbsp;highly rated and attended.&nbsp;That said, there are still plenty of other good sessions that should interest C# developers (I'll blog about them lest you get a bad opinion overall).</p> <p>One of my biggest issues is that the Smart Client track focuses way too much on Office. Office already has a dedicated <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/dec04/12-20OffDevCon2005PR.asp">Office Developer Conference</a>, so I personally don't think that more then half (14 out of 23) sessions needed to be dedicated to Office. Here's a quick breakdown</p> <ul> <li>3 InfoPath sessions <li>6 Office Programming Sessions (This includes niche sessions like programming Visio) <li>3 VSTO&nbsp;sessions <li>2 IBF&nbsp;sessions</li></ul> <p>Like I said before, there are only 2 dedicated C# sessions (and only 2 dedicated VB sessions for that matter, but they at least got a pre-con). So does this mean there are more InfoPath developers or VSTO developers in the world? Is it obvious that I'm bitter because I wanted more C# sessions?! Yes. Can you tell that the Smart Client track was run by someone in Office? </p> <p>Here are some gems that we had planned that got cut:</p> <ul> <li><font color="#000000"><strike>Visual C# 2003 Pre-Con<br /></strike>A full day of dedicated to learning C#</font> <li><font color="#000000"><strike>C# Language Enhancements</strike></font>&nbsp;<br />How can you cut a session given by Anders Hejlsberg that was in the <font color="#008000"><strong>top 5 sessions last year</strong></font>? <li><strike>C# Best Practices 1.1</strike> - Juval Lowy <li><strike>C# Best Practices 2.0</strike> - Juval Lowy <li><strike>Patterns and Practices - Best Practices for Smart Client Applications</strike> <li><strike>Patterns and Practices - Creating Applications using the UIP 2.0 Application Block</strike> <li><strike>Developing real-world .NET solutions for Microsoft Office 11 using Managed Code</strike>&nbsp;<br />People say Microsoft doesn't create applications that use the .NET Framework and they point to Office as an example. Well, Business Contact Manager is a fully managed application that ships with every copy of Office 2003 Professional. This would've been a killer session IMO. <li><strike>Best Practices &amp; Lessons Learned from .NET Framework 2.0 &amp; Visual Studio .NET 2005 Early Adopters</strike> <li><strike>The Well Designed API<br /></strike>There is however a great series on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/programming/classlibraries/default.aspx">MSDN for this now</a> <li><strike>Under the Covers: Generic Collections</strike> <li><strike>NET Smart Clients at Microsoft:&nbsp; Real Enterprise Solutions and Lessons Learned</strike>&nbsp;<br />We have an internal team that's developed and deployed an enterprise wide .NET Framework 2.0 application.

Here are some options (feel free to suggest more)</p> <ul> <li>Move to the cabana - This means no slides or demos, just a whiteboard <li>Make it a webcast <li>Something else entirely</li></ul> <p>Thoughts, ideas, opinions and suggestions welcome!</p> <p>&lt;/PersonalRant&gt;</p></div>
