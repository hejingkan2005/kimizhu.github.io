        I got back from TechEd New Zealand on Thursday and I'm still catching up on all my
        emails, and blogging is always Pri 2 so I'm taking the time out to catch up on blogging
        too.&#160; The city of sails was great although with three sessions I didn't have
        enough time to fully enjoy it.&#160; I did get to meet and hang out with <a href="http://www.datagridgirl.com/">DataGrid
        Girl</a> (who's on <a href="http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks.asp#thisweek">.NET
        Rocks </a>this week), <a href="http://www.microsoftregionaldirectors.com/Public/..%5Cextranet%5CDirectorDetails.aspx?did=1069">Tim</a>, <a href="http://teched.net.nz/Lists/Speakers/DispForm.aspx?ID=8">Matty</a>,
        and of course <a href="http://teched.net.nz/Lists/Speakers/DispForm.aspx?ID=11">Bix</a>.&#160;
        Bix started things off at the speaker dinner by performing Louis Armstrong's "What
        a Wonderful World" in only the way&#160;<a href="http://www.svoboda.co.nz/oxygen/content/teched2003/techspeakersevening07.jpg">he
        can</a>.&#160; After that, I didn't have much time to play as I had to prepare for&#160;three
        talks.&#160; The attendee party was on the night before the last&#160;day of TechEd
        and we all went and had a&#160;good time&#160;playing <a href="http://www.totalrebound.com/images/gamepix/Human_Foosball.jpeg">human
        foosball</a>, racing toilets (I went undefeated), riding pigs, having Matty beat me
        up in DOA and Tao Feng and much, much more.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll be posting answers to some of the questions I received during my talks and links
        to resources that I mentioned as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Big thanks to Pip, Paul, and Auckland for great hospitality.&#160; It's been a fun
        ride, but now I have to unbury my email...
