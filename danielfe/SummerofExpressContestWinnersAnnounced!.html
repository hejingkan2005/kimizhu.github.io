<div id='content'><p>After some really tough judging, we officially have the Summer of Express contest winners! There were some awesome applications in the C# category, I was really impressed by the work and level of effort put in by all the entrants. You can download the projects on <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/express/">Channel9's Express Page</a>.</p> <ul> <li>Visual Basic&nbsp;Express Edition - <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=23050">Exercise-it</a></li> <li>Visual C# Express Edition&nbsp;- <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=23089">Peg Games</a></li> <li>Visual C++ Express Edition&nbsp;- <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=23074">Voxygen Rendering Engine</a></li> <li>Visual J#&nbsp;Express Edition - <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=23100">Windows of Love</a></li> <li>Visual Web Developer Express Edition&nbsp;- <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=23091">Media Tracker</a></li> <li>SQL Server Express Express Edition&nbsp;- <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=23091">Media Tracker</a></li></ul> <p>&nbsp;We definitely want to do this contest again, but we're thinking about changing things up and wanted to get your feedback on what makes a good contest. Here's what I've been thinking</p> <ul> <li>Get Better prizes - This one requires a good amount of legal work far ahead of the contest, but it is doable</li> <li>Have prizes for 1st, 2nd, 3rd for a given category - I wish I could've given prizes to the top 5 C# entries :)</li> <li>Change the categories - Rather then be product focused, I would imagine categories like - Best Game, Best productivity tool, Best utility, Best use of the network, Best use of SQL Server, Best Web app</li></ul> <p>What do you think makes a good contest?<br /></p></div>
