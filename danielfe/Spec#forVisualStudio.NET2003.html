<div id='content'><p>From the research web site:</p> <p><em>The Spec# programming system is a new attempt at a more cost effective way to develop and maintain high-quality software.&nbsp;&nbsp; The system consists of:</em></p> <ul> <li><em>A programming methodology, which includes a sound treatment of object invariants in object-oriented programs. </em> <li><em>The Spec# programming language, which is a superset of C# and adds things like non-null types, checked exceptions, method contracts (like pre- and postconditions), and object invariants. </em> <li><em>The Spec# compiler, which is integrated into the Microsoft Visual Studio development environment, statically enforces non-null types, emits run-time checks for method contracts and invariants, and records the specifications in metadata for consumption by the program verifier. </em> <li><em>The Spec# static program verifier, which translates programs into logical verification conditions, which are passed to an automatic theorem prover. </em> <li><em>An interface to the SpecExplorer tool for test generation and model-based testing. </em></li></ul> <p>More info: <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/SpecSharp/">http://research.microsoft.com/SpecSharp/</a></p> <p>If you've ever read the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/020161622X?v=glance">Pragmatic Programmer</a> or done contract-based programming before with tools like <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2001/jw-0216-cooltools.html">iContract</a>, you'll instantly see the value of pre- and post- conditions for code.</p></div>
