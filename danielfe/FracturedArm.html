<div id='content'><p>I haven't been blogging lately, mainly because I'm busy and because I fractured my arm. It happened about two weeks ago while playing roller hockey. I was going full speed from left to right and only had the goalie to beat. The goalie jumped out of the net, sending me airborn and I landed on the flat of my left hand. Both me and the puck had gotten past the goalie and the puck was sitting about a foot away from an empty net, but I couldn't move my left arm to shovel the puck into the net. A defenseman came and cleared the puck and I went to the bench holding my arm. After the scorekeeper (a goalie himself) convinced me to go to the hospital, I changed gear, drove home (one-handed with a stick-shift Wrangler), showered (hockey smell takes on a life of its own) and had the Mrs. take me to the hospital at around 11:30pm. It turns out that Tuesday nights are a busy&nbsp;night in the ER and having gone to *the* trauma hospital in the Seattle Metro area so car accidents and others less fortunate were medivac'd in throughout the night. I got&nbsp;several x-rays and was given morphine as they had to "manipulate" (aka move in unbelievably painful ways) my arm to see if I needed to be sent to surgery.&nbsp;Even though I was in a&nbsp;good amount&nbsp;of pain, I quickly realized&nbsp;I have it pretty good when the person&nbsp;next&nbsp;to&nbsp;me can barely walk because of bad chest pains or another who is paralyzed from the waist down having been shot five times&nbsp;in the first hour after arriving on a "peace keeping" mission to distribute food in Mogadishu for <a href="http://www.royal-marines.mod.uk/static/pages/141.html">her Majesty's Royal Marines</a>&nbsp;(think <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265086/">Black Hawk Down</a>).&nbsp;Five+ hours later I was released with a fractured radius&nbsp;and was told they would need to check whether or not I would need surgery the following week. Luckily I&nbsp;didn't. The worst part is that I had to give a talk the very next day at 10am&nbsp;and all of my demos are how Visual Studio makes writing code easier, I had to change them in the five hours before my demo. I changed them, went through my script and "slept" for about two hours and warned the audience that I was given the presentation on "drugs" to much laughter. All-in-all, my talk went well. I've been in physical therapy quite a bit, and I'm healing fine and most importantly for my job, I'm typing with two hands. I'm in a sling for two months, but I'll be back on skates soon therafter. In the meantime, I may not be blogging as often as I would like (my blog queue is still way high) but this is mainly because I have a *huge* workload write now and I've signed up for even more work this fiscal year. *Sigh*.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div>
