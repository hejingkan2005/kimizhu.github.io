        <b>Confessional: </b>Please forgive me, it's been about a week since my last blog,
        but I haven't had any free time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Dallas was exhausting, but all the locals were great and really made the trip worth
        it. I met so many great people in such a short amount of time!

        I met with MikeH who I used to work with while&#160;in&#160;DC.&#160; He's done a
        lot of neat stuff using Active Directory, Exchange and .NET, but he also had some
        valid complaints about not being able to find .NET samples on the web for this stuff.&#160;
        For those of you interested, there are some nice add-ins to the Server Explorer like
        the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C82D7AB5-40A5-4DD4-9595-53A79FF2C5BC&amp;displaylang=en">AD
        add-in</a> (seems to only work with VS 7.0), <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=62d91a63-1253-4ea6-8599-68fb3ef77de1&amp;displaylang=en">WMI
        extensions</a>, and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/techinfo/development/2000/enablekit.asp">Web
        Services Toolkit for Exchange</a>. <a href="http://www.devhawk.net/Default.aspx?date=6%2f2%2f2003">Harry
        also blogged</a> on some newly announced VS.NET Power Toys. If you're interested in
        using AD for applications, make sure you check out <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/adam/default.mspx">AD

        After working all night on demos, my Middle Tier apps with C# presentation went well,
        again thank all of you who attended!&#160; The bad part was that my web service security
        demo proved too secure to work in front of the crowd.&#160; Luckily, I was able to
        draw parallels between why people watch Nascar and technical presentations...it's
        all about the crashes.&#160; The reason my demo didn't work, or didn't work without
        a network connection, is that it was trying to validate against my corporate domain,
        which it did successfully in my hotel room when connected to the network, but failed
        in front of my now most intimate acquaintances:).&#160; I've received a lot of great
        feedback on my demos and I promise to upload them soon to my team page, once I get
        it setup on GDN.&#160; I'll also probably post a blog entry that walks through the
        code for those interested. 
        <br />
        <em>&lt;aside&gt;</em>I'm also looking to create a simple P2P remoting application
        that shares images in a specific directory Napster-style between users and adds those
        images to a screensaver.&#160; I'll get to it in&#160; my "free" time. <em>&lt;aside&gt;</em> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Wednesday night we also had a "Hang with the C# Team" event and while we didn't have
        great attendance, there was a lot of really good conversation points.&#160; These
        lucky attendees also walked away with C# t-shirts and the ever-so-coveted C# press-on
        tattoo.

        <strong>Thursday</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        On Thursday <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/csharp/team/ericgu/default.aspx">EricGu</a> and
        I went to go meet with one of our local customers that's doing a lot of cool stuff
        with .NET today.&#160; They gave us fantastic feedback into what's difficult today
        and how we can make their lives easier. I really think we can make some great changes
        in the next couple of revs of VS that will absolutely change the way developers work. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Thursday evening, EricGu and I had a C# User Group meeting in Irving, Texas.&#160;
        This was another awesome meeting and it's always enlightening to get about 60 developers
        with varied backgrounds in a room talking about programming language design, and what
        features will make the next killer application.&#160; We had the user group vote for
        what they want in the next release (#1 release framework source, #2 Edit &amp; Continue).&#160;
        What was interesting was that some of the requests people asked for are currently
        available in the .NET Framework or VS.NET (it's almost like we have clairvoyance).&#160;
        In case others don't know about these, I'll comment on some of them here: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>Suggestion: Borland has a shortcut key, CTRL+click, that&#160;jumps to the definition.
            Add this to VS.NET.&#160; </em>You can Right click on a member and select Go To Definition
            or click F12 to go directly to a class definition in VS.NET. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Suggestion: Make remoting work through firewalls</em>. Remoting can be used between
            firewalls, and while DCOM could, it was quite a pain. Simply specify that the formatter
            will be <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemRuntimeSerializationFormattersSoap.asp">SOAP</a> and
            not binary. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Suggestion: Make&#160;working with client events&#160;available for Remoting</em> -
            This is possible, check out Ingo's article on <a href="http://www.ingorammer.com/RemotingFAQ/CAOS_INTERNET_FIREWALL.html">CAO
            through firewalls</a> and this tutorial on working with <a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/Tutorial/ShowContent.aspx?cg=BFB598D4-0CC8-4392-893D-30252E2B3283&amp;forumid=4262">remoting
            events</a> on <a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com">DotNetJunkies</a>. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        After the user group meeting, (PS to those of you in Dallas, I'm mailing about 16
        shirts for those who didn't get one after the meeting), Eric and I drove to the attendee
        party.&#160; This was a lot of fun, but since we didn't get out of the UG meeting
        until late, we only had about 1 1/2 hours to frag other attendees at Halo.&#160; I
        think we stood our own, and from what I hear, the C# team is outstanding at Halo.&#160;
        The attendee party stopped at midnight, but we were just getting started.&#160; Brian
        (B2), me and several other members of our team went to the Velvet Hookah where I met&#160;<a href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/webLog/donnymack/">Donny
        Mack</a> and company and had an amazing time! This place completely resurrected my
        opinion of Dallas nightlife. Read <a href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/donnymack/archive/06062003.aspx">Donny's
        post</a> for more details...

    <p>
        By Friday, I was at the WiFi-enabled&#160;DFW airport&#160;where I had my first "celebrity"
        run-in, a TechEd attendee screamed out my name on the tran to tell me he had been
        to my session and really enjoyed it, which made a week's worth of sleep deprivation
        worth it.
