<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I'm back from TechEd Europe where I ran into a case of the angry demo gods during my C# IDE Enhancements sessions. <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joen/">Joe</A> gave this session in San Diego and&nbsp;did a great job so I had my work cut out to match his greatness. It's always great to find bad product bugs during a talk, it can only make you stronger for your next talk :)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Setup for demo failure</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Part 1 - </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>I was showing the new behavior of the Go To Definition Window. In Visual Studio 2003, if you right-click on a .NET Framework type (or a type that you don't have the source code for) it would open the Object Browser window. In Visual Studio 2005, right-clicking on a type w/o source code and selecting &#8220;Go To Definition&#8221; shows the metadata for the type as a source code file.&nbsp; The image below shows the dynamically generated source file based on the String class in the System namespace</FONT></P><IMG src="http://www.danfernandez.com/view/view.aspx?ID=36"> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Part 2 - I was showing off the some&nbsp;cool new options available in Visual Studio 2005 when you click on a file tab. These features include:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Close All But This </STRONG>- This will close all files except for the selected file which is great when you have 10-20 files open and only want to work with one</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Copy Full Path </STRONG>- This copies the full path to the selected file to the clipboard, convenient for jumping to a command line</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Open Containing Folder </STRONG>- This opens the folder that contains the source code file, great for when you need to manipulate files and you would rather not have to navigate through c:\documents and settings\[username]\My Documents\ etc</FONT></LI></UL><IMG src="http://www.danfernandez.com/view/view.aspx?ID=37"> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Combining these steps for disaster</STRONG></FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>Right click on a type that you don't have source code for&nbsp;(like System.String) and select Go To Definition...&nbsp; This will create a Metadata as source file as shown above.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>Next, right click on the file name created in the last step and select &#8220;Open Containing Folder&#8220;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>Wait ~30 seconds for Visual Studio to think and then watch as the screen goes black and you see the Virtual PC rebooting</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>Insert Homer Simpson &#8220;doh!&#8220;</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>To add insult to injury, my VPC hard drive which is a second hard drive in place of my&nbsp;CD player, stopped being recognized so even after restarting it wasn't working.&nbsp; Luckily for me, I was showing VWD Express in my next demo and I could use C# Express for another demo so I only didn't get to show FxCop integration and the Object Test&nbsp;Bench demo.&nbsp; OTB is one of the least known feature in Visual Studio 2005 so I'll be blogging about my demo later...&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: You'll need the May Community Tech Preview to have this crash as Beta 1 works and opens the folder to: </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>C:\DOCUME~1\[username]\LOCALS~1\Temp\3124$CommonLanguageRuntimeLibrary$v2.0.40607\System.String.cs</FONT></P>
