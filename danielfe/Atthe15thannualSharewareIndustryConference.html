<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I'm way too busy at the </FONT><A href="http://www.sic.org"><FONT face=Arial size=2>Shareware Industry Conference</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>, but here's a quick brain dump.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I met with John Lueders of </FONT><A href="http://www.elmsoftware.com/"><FONT face=Arial size=2>ElmSoftware</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> who created </FONT><A href="http://www.elmsoftware.com/ido/"><FONT face=Arial size=2>iDo 2005</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>, some very cool looking and useful&nbsp;Wedding software. It's got 5 stars by CNET. I can tell you that my wife, Angie, would have loved this software. We talked about adding some cool features based on&nbsp;things that I remember Angie complaining about and even&nbsp;expanding into&nbsp;creating a mobile version.&nbsp;If you're getting married,&nbsp;check this out...&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I also spoke with David Mahon, FBI Supervisory Special Agent after his "Cyber Crime" session. His wife works at Microsoft and he's definitely an interesting guy. He told us some stories about how hackers would break into companies and extort them for money or else they would release their entire customer database (credit cards and all). To show that they had access to this data, they would send them the full list of customers who's names started with the letter "A" and demand to be payed or else they would release the full list of customers. Ouch!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Michael Lehman has an interesting post about the </FONT><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2005/07/14/438936.aspx"><FONT face=Arial size=2>history of Microsoft and Shareware</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> and how the term "shareware" came from from Bob Wallace, Microsoft employee #9. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>You can find more at the event</FONT></P>
