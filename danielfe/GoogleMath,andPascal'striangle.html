        Google recently added a cool <a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#calculator">calulator
        feature</a>.<br />
        Simply enter a math formula like "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=5*5">5 *
        5</a>" into Google and it will return a results page with the answer.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        &#160;Asking Google: "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=the%20answer%20to%20life,%20the%20universe%20and%20everything">The
        answer to life, the universe and everything</a>" returns the calculator and the answer&#160;42,
        based on the calculation by Deep Thought, the super computer in the Douglas Adam's&#160;classic
        "Life the Universe and Everything". 
        <br />
        Google also links to a <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything">Wikipedia
        entry</a>&#160;that explains how 6 * 9 = 42 (hint: not base 10) and how code written
        in C using macros also correctly multiplies 6*9=42.&#160; I also work in building
        42 which makes it that much more special :) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another cool feature I discovered is that Google does factorials. Entering&#160;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=4!">4!</a> and
        you'll see 4*3*2*1 (x * x-1) or 24.&#160; This reminded me of French mathematician
        Blaise Pascal who's Pascal triangle solves probabability questions. For example, look
        at the triangle below: 
    </p>
    <pre>1			1	1
	
2		    1       2       1

3		1	3	3	1

4	    1	    4	    6	    4       1

5	1	5	10	10	5	1

6   1	    6      15        20      15      6       1


</pre>
    Both parents sum to be the total of each child: <pre>1	2
    3
</pre>
    and <pre>4	6
   10
</pre>
    <p>
        The numbers horizontally represents the possibilities of elements being picked.&#160;
        Let's use the 4th row and letters A, B, C, D as examples. The fourth row represents
        the numbers 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 which represent the probability of choosing 0, 1, 2, 3,
        and 4 of the letters. Let's look at each of these: 
    </p>
    <p>
        0 - There is only one option for picking none of the letters. 
        <br />
        1 - Since there are four unique letters, there are four unique possibilities.&#160; 
        <br />
        2 - There are six ways of picking exactly two letters: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. 
        <br />
        3 - There are four ways of picking three out of the four elements, simply choose which
        letter you are not going to pick. 
        <br />
        4 - There is only one way to select all of the letters. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Whew, with that explained, we can look at the mathematical formula for this: 
        <br />
        N!/(R!(N!-R!)) where N represents the number of elements and R represents the number
        of matches. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Using our example above, where N is 4 and&#160;we'll set 2 as the number of matches,
        we get:
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=4!/(2!(4-2)!)">&#160;4!/(2!(4-2)!)</a>.&#160;
        Google correctly answers this as 6, matching the value in Pascal's triangle.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you&#160;didn't have&#160;Google, you can represent&#160;Pascal's formula in C#
        with the code below:&#160; 
    </p>
    <pre>	
class f
{
	//Factorial
	private static long fac(long x)
	{
		for(long i=x-1;i&gt;0;i--)
		{
			x *= i;			
		}
		return x;
	
	}

	public static long Pascal(long n, long r)
	{
		
		return fac(n)/(fac(r) * fac(n-r));
	
	}
}
</pre>
    <p>
        Another interesting mathematical pattern in Pascal's triangle is the Fibonacci sequence
        on the triangle diagonals.

        Cool stuff, now do we call Google's calculator a web service?
