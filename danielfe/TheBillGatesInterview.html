<div id='content'><P>I'm such a huge Bill Gates fan, not only for his technical and business brilliance, but for all of the work his foundation has done. That's why when <A class="" href="http://www.jeffsandquist.com/" mce_href="http://www.jeffsandquist.com">Jeff Sandquist</A> and Charles Torre told me I was going to be interviewing Bill, I was....beside myself. The interview went well (in that I didn't pee my pants or kneel to kiss his ring like some bad Italian mafia flick) and it was fascinating hearing how Bill still prototypes code/APIs and how he's looking to do even more coding on health and education applications for the foundation.&nbsp;The other cool part is hearing Bill hint about how Access will now be a tool for the Web. Many a developer has cut his teeth building Access applications and seeing Access go beyond desktop applications is <STRONG>huge</STRONG>.
