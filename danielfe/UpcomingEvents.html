<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This week's been super busy, and I'm probably not going to have any free or personal time.&nbsp; I won't even attempt to list my To-Do list here, but I'm really, really busy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>You may be interested in hearing about some upcoming developer events.</FONT></P>
<P><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/middleeast/egypt/english/events/MDC2004.asp"><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Middle East Developer's Conference 2004</STRONG></FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> (Jan 24-27, Cairo, Egypt) - I'll be presenting two sessions on Visual Studio Whidbey including ASP.NET and C#.&nbsp; BillG is doing the keynote so it should be a great event to attend. I've also never been to Egypt and I've heard it is absolutely beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/seminar/devdays2004/default.mspx"><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Developer Days 2004</STRONG></FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> - This is a multi-city worldwide tour event which promises to be exciting. There are two tracks&nbsp;covering Smart Client development and Web development, and both will have good coverage of security fundamentals.&nbsp; In fact the&nbsp;web track is actually based on&nbsp;the eWeek </FONT><A href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,741388,00.asp"><FONT face=Arial size=2>OpenHack contest</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> [Aside- no one broke&nbsp;MS security during OpenHack]. We will also be showing off some of the new features available in Visual Studio Whidbey, so if you didn't get a chance to hit PDC, this is the next best thing.&nbsp; Plus, all attendees will receive a copy of Visual Studio &#8220;Whidbey&#8221; (the PDC build) just for attending,&nbsp;and a CD with all of the sample code.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><A href="http://www.imaginecup.com"><STRONG>Imagine Cup 2004</STRONG></A> - The Imagine Cup web site is now up and running!&nbsp; For those of you who may not know, Imagine Cup is a contest open to all students to share their brilliant ideas with the world.&nbsp; The Imagine Cup has expanded this year to include the following categories: </FONT><A href="http://www.imaginecup.com/softwaredesign.aspx"><FONT face=Arial size=2>Software Design</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>, </FONT><A href="http://www.imaginecup.com/algorithm.aspx"><FONT face=Arial size=2>Algorithm</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> design, </FONT><A href="http://www.imaginecup.com/shortfilm.aspx"><FONT face=Arial size=2>short film</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>, and </FONT><A href="http://www.imaginecup.com/rendering.aspx"><FONT face=Arial size=2>rendering</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>.&nbsp; You can even submit entries for&nbsp;the last three categories&nbsp;online.&nbsp; This article has some good info on&nbsp; <A href="http://www.reachlive.net/news/2003/jul/news_02a.htm">last year's contest winner</A> (who won over 100K student entries). If the </FONT><A href="http://www.redvsblue.com/"><FONT face=Arial size=2>red vs blue</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> guys are students, they should submit their best entry for short film :)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Another cool feature on the Imagine Cup site is the interactive </FONT><A href="http://www.imaginecup.com/worldwide.aspx"><FONT face=Arial size=2>Worldview</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> that let's you zoom-in to see where the Software Design Invitationals will be held.</FONT></P>

<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>VS Connections (April 18-21)</STRONG><BR>Is anyone going to <A href="http://www.vsconnections.com">VS Connections</A> in Orlando next week? I'll be there, it should be lots of fun.&nbsp; I'm trying to cook up some fun demos for my talk on What's new with the C# IDE. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Bay.NET User Group (April 27)<BR></STRONG>I'll also be speaking at the Bay.NET user group on what's coming in C# 2.0 thanks to all-around good guy and C# rock star, <A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/jlowy">Juval Lowy</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/teched/">TechEd</A> US (May 24-27)<BR></STRONG>I'll be there, and I won't be speaking&nbsp;which should&nbsp;give me&nbsp;ample time to actually enjoy the event.&nbsp; I'm always afraid to party too&nbsp;hard&nbsp;anywhere near Southern California.&nbsp;&nbsp;My fear is&nbsp;I'll&nbsp;&nbsp; wake up in Tijuana with unspeakable piercings, no money, and another wife. Well, maybe Tijuana won't be so bad after all :)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>San Diego .NET User Group (during TechEd, Tuesday May 25)<BR></STRONG>Tim Huckaby, rock star and probably the accomplice who'll drive me to Tijuana, runs the San Diego .NET user group, and <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ansonh">Anson</A>&nbsp;and <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joen/">Joe</A> are planning on presenting.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/europe/teched/">TechEd Europe</A> - Amsterdam (June 29 - July 2)<BR></STRONG>This should be a really fun time, I'll probably be doing two C# sessions (TBD). I haven't been to Amsterdam since I was in my early teens, and that was with the parental units&nbsp;so this trip should be a bit different. </FONT></P>
