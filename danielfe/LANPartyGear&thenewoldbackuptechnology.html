        The next time you're heading out to that LAN party and you need to transport&#160;
        your <a href="http://www.alienware.com/review_pages/review_template.aspx?FileName=review_cnet_041403.asp">tricked
        out</a> computer, don't carry it by hand, instead use <a href="http://www.geargrip.com/">GearGrip </a>to
        transport both your PC and monitor. <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com">Tom's Hardware</a> has
        the <a href="http://www6.tomshardware.com/game/20030913/index.html">product review</a>.

        <strong>DV Streamer</strong> 
        <br />
        Tom's Hardware also has a <a href="http://www6.tomshardware.com/storage/20030912/index.html">review</a> of
        software that creates a new way of using one of the oldest backup technologies around,
        tape.&#160; A software company called&#160;<a href="http://www.dvstreamer.com/">DVStreamer</a> has
        created a way to use miniDV tapes from camcorders&#160;as a simple and more importantly <strong>cheap </strong>way
        to backup all your files.&#160; Per the review, the software is still buggy, but it's
        a cheap ($50 for the&#160;s/w)&#160;and easy to backup 8-15gigs on a 60 minute DV
        tape. Sweet! In a couple of years, it would be great to see this refined, less error
        prone, &#160;and as easy as one click.&#160; But then again, I hope we won't be using
        tape in a couple of years.&#160; I also think <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/bgold/">Goldfarb</a> needs
        to get someone to redesign their site before it's added to the list of <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/">unmentionables</a>.<br />
