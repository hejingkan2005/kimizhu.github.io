        I have bad luck driving into work lately, on Wednesday there was a truck that had
        engine problems on 520 (the bridge that connects Seattle to MSHQ and which already <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/danielfe/PermaLink.aspx/74c6733c-d705-4f78-845a-a7d1b4951d89">killed
        one of my computers</a>) and my commute was about an hour.&#160; On the way home I
        didn't have any problems, but coming in on Thursday morning 520 was backed up pretty
        bad from an accident involving a Mazda Miata and two other vehicles which made my
        commute over an hour!&#160; I typically leave work late and miss the hellish commute
        crossing 520 back to Seattle, but on Thursday evening there was a Mercedes that apparently
        died and traffic was again backed up.&#160; So three out of four times commuting to
        work I've&#160;chosen the exact time when accidents or disabled vehicles are on 520.&#160;
        I also recently discovered that there are patron saints for just about <a href="http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/patron00.htm">everything</a>,
        including patrons&#160;saints&#160;against moles, &#160;bartenders, computers, drivers,
        gravel, &#160;skating, toothaches, and *many* more.&#160; There is&#160;apparently&#160;no
        patron saint of traffic, or as I&#160;was previously told&#160;by my sister, there
        is no patron saint of&#160;good parking spots (Aunt Betty), although she has helped
        me during the holidays when I go to the mall.

        Speaking of cars, Ford recently re-released my new vehicular love, the Ford GT.&#160;
        It's out of my league,&#160;but I'm&#160;saving pocket change everyday in hopes of
        putting&#160;it on lay away.&#160; <img src="http://www.fordvehicles.com/fordgt/images/photo_gallery/ph_gt_popup_4.jpg" />

        You can read more about it and entice your salivary glands at the <a href="http://www.fordvehicles.com/fordgt/gallery.asp?bhcp=1">Ford
        GT site</a>.

        I can deal with traffic on 520 if I had this car :)&#160;
