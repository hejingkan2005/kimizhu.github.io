    Thanks <a href="http://www.inkblog.com/2003/05/29.html">David</a>. I checked into
    the Hyatt Regency last night only to realize, as David had, that the Hyatt Regency
    is *very* low tech with no high speed internet access, except for their business center
    which charges $10/hour and isn't open 24 hours a day.&#160; I was planning on calling
    up all the local hotels to see if they had high-speed net access, when I came across
    David's post. So&#160;I officially checked into the <a href="http://www.adamsmark.com/index.asp">Adam's
    Mark</a> hotel today which is cheaper (even if you include the costs of net access),
    has more convenient access to the parking garage, late night room service, and best
    of all, the lobby has two stands chock full of cookies, brownies and lemonade as a
    welcome to all TechEd attendees, and by sheer coincidence, David was in the lobby&#160;so
    we chatted for a bit.&#160; Since I mentioned&#160;David, I should also thank him
    for lending me his <a href="http://www.inkblog.com/2003/05/20.html">desktop</a> workhorse
    for last month's Frag party.&#160; The reason I needed David's machine is that I damaged
    mine while driving to the party.&#160;&#160;While on&#160;520,&#160;the bridge that
    connects the west side (Seattle) to the east side (Redmond/Bellevue) I had to slam
    the brakes and my server slammed forward into my car (Always buckle up your machines).&#160;
    The machine wouldn't boot at all afterwards, even after I opened her up to make sure
    nothing was loose.&#160; After inspecting the machine internals me and the "Mrs."
    discovered that the CPU's heat sink had fallen off and the snap that holds it in place
    is also broken.&#160; I'll have to check if my machine's still&#160;under warranty,
    but since I was considering buying a machine just for fragging, David, who had just
    bought his machine, sent me a spreadsheet with parts from <a href="http://www.googlegear.com/jsp/Home.jsp">Google
    Gear</a> and the whole machine will probably run me about $1,200. Excellent.&#160;
    While we're on the topic of gaming, you can find local places to frag at <a href="http://www.lanparty.com">LanParty</a>,
    register your <a href="http://www.gamertagdatabase.com">XBL gamertag</a>, and since
    it just passed, check out the <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/e32003/preview/pc/1001750/">GameSpy
    Awards</a> for the best of E3. </a></a>
