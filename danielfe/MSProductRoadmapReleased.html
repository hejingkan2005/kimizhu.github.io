        If you do any .NET development, you absolutely have to see our officially released <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx">Product
        Roadmap</a>.&#160; There's a section on C#&#160;futures that should interest developers
        and&#160;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/blogs/ericr/">EricR </a>did a keynote
        at VS Live NY with <a href="http://www.universalthread.com/Magazine/June2001/AriBixhorn.jpg">Bix </a>showing
        off the new features for Windows Forms and ASP.NET. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of *my*&#160;favorite project improvements are: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>SQL Server CLR Integration:</strong> Create functions, stored procedures,
        triggers, types, and aggregates in any .NET language (C#, VB.NET, etc) 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Windows Forms No Touch Deployment</strong>: <em>"New capabilities will include
        support for running applications offline, rolling back to previous versions of an
        application, and listing an application in the Windows Start menu as well as the Remove
        Programs catalog within the Control Panel. Additionally, No-Touch Deployment in Whidbey
        will enable developers to distribute the .NET Framework with a Windows client application."</em> 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Winforms Improvements</strong>: Host Office Documents using the Active Document
        Container, Office-style toolbars, a better web browser control (no more AX code!),
        and the background worker for async tasks. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>ASP.NET: </strong>The DataSource control makes working with relational, xml
        and other data sources *much* easier.&#160; The GridView is a DataGrid with everything
        you had to manually add (paging, sorting, editing, and deleting).&#160; The Details
        View shows you details about a specific record, Master Pages lets you set&#160;the
        UI for your web page&#160;once (header, background, etc) and have all other pages
        inherit that UI.&#160; The ASP.NET team has also gone the extra mile and added themes
        and skins for easy&#160;web site customization.&#160; You really need to see ASP.NET
        2.0 in person to realize how much easier it will be&#160;to develop web UI.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>ADO.NET: </strong>Gains better debugging, built in XQuery capabilities and
        object persistence using ObjectSpaces. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Enterprise Tools</strong>: <em>"Microsoft will deliver a set of visual designers
        that help architects translate their requirements into Web services-based applications
        and components. The designers will provide modeling support for describing these applications
        and components, along with corresponding policy for security, protocols, and more.
        The designers will also enable developers to map their logical application to their
        physical production environment, making it easier to deploy complex Web services-based
        solutions." </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>SourceSafe Revamp</strong>: <em>"In Whidbey, Microsoft will improve upon the
        Visual SourceSafe tools and offer programmers working in small teams the technology
        they need to manage source code as well as other files in their solution. Visual SourceSafe
        will be extended to offer support for Web service and Unicode projects, helping programmers
        more effectively meet the challenges of today's business. Further, programmers will
        enjoy improved performance and tighter integration between Visual SourceSafe and the
        Visual Studio IDE." </em>
