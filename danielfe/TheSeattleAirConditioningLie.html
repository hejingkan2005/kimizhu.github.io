In July, it&#8217;s 21 out of 31 days that are expected to be &gt; 75 degrees.

It&#8217;s sticky, our windows only open a solid 7&#8221; and we face west which maximizes our exposure to sunlight. Last night, the only way I fell asleep was by putting a bag of ice&nbsp;wrapped in a towel underneath me. It's that bad.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

He had his porch door wide open but it wasn&#8217;t enough. When I asked him how he could possibly go to sleep in this heat, he did finally admit that he uses an oscillating fan on his bed. Since when have fans and open windows been a good thing? You end up getting insects (especially at night as they are attracted to the light), in the city you hear almost constant street noise and you&#8217;ve also opened yourself up to theft.

<P class=body>June 29 -<EM> <STRONG>Jeanette and Jon Elkins are warning their Kent neighborhood to keep windows closed at night, despite the hot weather</STRONG>....The Elkins are speaking from experience. They left the rear window of their home open Monday night. At 2:30 in the morning, they found out why police cautioned against leaving windows open without stops or wooden dowels to keep the opening so small a person could not climb through. At that time, while one of their two daughters was already in bed with them, a noise woke up Jeanette. She told KOMO 4 News she thought: " 'Who's there? Is that our other daughter coming in?' And then I realized he was hooded. And I went, 'Oh my God!' Like, 'Jon, someone's in our house!
