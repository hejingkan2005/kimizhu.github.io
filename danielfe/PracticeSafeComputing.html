        I received an email today from admin&#160;@ Microsoft dotcom saying my password has
        expired with a zip attachment indicating instructions.&#160; Not being gullible, but
        still being curious, I virus scanned&#160;the attachment&#160;and saw that it was
        indeed a virus.&#160; I forwarded the mail to our security team for investigation,
        but it brings up a good point.&#160; Don't run attachments, patch your machines regularly
        and practice safe computing.&#160; My quick tips, 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Don't believe everything you read in email. Not sure? Check <a href="http://urbanlegends.com/ulz/">here </a>or <a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blxatoz.htm">here</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't run attachments if you don't know where they are coming from 
        </li>
        <li>
            Use and update your antivirus software 
        </li>
        <li>
            Use <a href="http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/default.asp">Windows Update</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a firewall and block everything but the necessary ports. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There's also&#160;been some news about a vulnerability affecting DCOM which lives
        inside the RPC process, with a&#160;patch available through <a href="http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/default.asp">Windows
        Update</a>, which you should visit&#160;if you don't have the RPC patch installed.
