<div id='content'><p>I ran into this <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=112716">bug</a> today which was unfortunately closed as can't repro. I was renaming some AppSettings variable names (right click on a Project's&#160; Properties and go to the Settings tabs) and deleting some other settings, when I did a Search/Replace for the entire solution and somehow wound up with a duplicate Settings.Designer.cs file named Settings1.Designer.cs. This was effectively a clone of Settings.Designer.cs which meant:</p>  <ul>   <li>IntelliSense would report that any AppSettings variables were declared multiple times</li>    <li>The project wouldn't compile because the variables were already declared</li> </ul>  <p>The fix was to </p>  <ul>   <li>From the Error menu, double click the Settings1.Designer.cs file to open it. Right click on the file and select <strong>Open Containing Folder</strong> and backup the the offending file(s) first (just in case).</li>    <li>After backing up, delete the <strong>Settings1.Designer.cs</strong> file </li>    <li>Switch back to VS and ensure <strong>Show All Files </strong>is selected in the <strong>Solution Explorer</strong></li>    <li>Expand Settings.settings in the Solution Explorer and manually delete Settings1.Designer.cs (and if prompted say yes to removal from source control)</li>    <li>Select Build...Clean Project... (or Solution as appropriate)</li> </ul>  <p>You should be good to go, if you get an error about a missing file, you may need to manually open your <strong>csproj </strong>or <strong>sln </strong>file in Notepad and ensure that the MSBuild script doesn't contain a link to Settings1.Designer.cs.</p></div>
