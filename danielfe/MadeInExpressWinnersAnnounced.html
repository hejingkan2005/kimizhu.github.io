<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Arial size=4><STRONG>The Winners Are In!</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Today we officially announced the winners to the <A href="http://www.madeinexpress.com/">Made In Express</A> Contest including the&nbsp;Grand Prize ($10,000 US), First Prize, and Community Choice winners. The competition was tight and the voting even produced a tie for first place. Rather than breaking the tie, we’ve decided to recognize two First Prize awards! Read on to see who <A href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Robert Scoble</A>, <A href="http://makezine.com/blog/">Phil Torrone</A> and <A href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris Pirillo </A>voted for:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Ernie’s all-terrain self-maneuverable robot was a huge favorite with the judges. “<EM>Ernie Hall’s robot just stood out</EM>,” says judge Robert Scoble, “<EM>His videos, blogs, and the project itself made it a clear winner right away</EM>.” Ernie encourages everyone to keep on learning, recently posting “You can learn C# even if you are 65” in his blog. As a professor at the University of Cincinnati, Hall now plans to turn his code and blog entries into a course for my computer science and engineering robotics students. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Ali’s idea to help people communicate via instant messaging in different languages came from a personal need, “<EM>I have a friend in France whose English is not so good, so whenever we are talking on the MSN Messenger, I copy what ever he says, paste it into a translation service, then type my reply in English, translate it into French and copy it back in MSN Messenger.</EM>” From the start, people loved Ali’s idea to bring people closer together, “<EM>…what i mean to say that your idea will help many people out there, it'll help communicating with people so i wish u good luck with your idea,</EM>” says one commenter on his blog.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Jonas helped us all take a step closer to publishing our own newspaper based on the news we care about. FeedJournal is “<EM>actually a little glimpse of the future…it will likely be a common way for readers to ‘roll their own’ magazines in the near future</EM>” says judge Phil Torrone, Senior Editor of Make Magazine. Jonas plans to continue development of FeedJournal and even aspires to make a commercial version of the application available. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Roman’s curmudgeon chat bot styled on the popular television show “Dr. House” was a big favorite with the community voters. Clearly, thinking about the larger community is a big deal for him. “<EM>The fun thing about this competition are the diversity of people involved in it,</EM>” says Canlas, “<EM>We can conclude that technology is universal despite of your race and color</EM>”. </FONT></P>
