Everyone really worked their tails off. Well done!</p> <p>Why did we add Edit and Continue? Because you <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/viewFeedback.aspx?feedbackid=bbbf7d31-204c-4a93-af08-fb80328fbe86">really, really wanted it</a>. We're listening&nbsp;to you and trying to&nbsp;continuously build a better product. We&nbsp;can't&nbsp;add everything you want, but we'll try our hardest to make the best product for you.</p></div>
