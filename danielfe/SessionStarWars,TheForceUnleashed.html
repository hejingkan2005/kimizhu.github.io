Havok</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>DMM - Provides real-world simulation technologies, prepare for a massive bug count, unpredictable </li>    <li>Havok - Physics system </li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>How it all has come together</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>First time shown outside of LucasArts </li>    <li>Force Grip - grab onto other objects to try to protect himself, similar to Valve's gravity gun      <ul>       <li>Teaches puzzles (open doors) </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Combo system - follow certain attacks </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Cinematics</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Tighten script - 20 revisions, are we saying the riht thing </li>    <li>Get performs </li>    <li>Facial Likeness Capture - Facial mode cap (dots on their face to capture their emotions, bring them all in, chemistry is different </li>    <li>ILM tools - CloneKim&#160;
