<div id='content'><p><strong>Reader Question</strong>: What's the most complex data structure you've ever run into or had to program against?</p> <p>My personal one was the&nbsp;"<a href="http://www.mismo.org">Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization</a>"&nbsp;(you can download it if you're bored)&nbsp;which is a monster DTD that&nbsp;includes just about everything a real estate/mortgage or financial company could want.&nbsp; In any case, creating "fake" data [for a customer prototype using BizTalk]&nbsp;for this thing was tough, and showing how each different partner organization could use part of this data in their application as part of an orchestrated process was tougher. </p> <p>Here's another one (although I haven't written code for this), the Visual Studio 2005 has a way to export your IDE settings into a *.vssettings file. So I did this with C# Express and I got a nice 400K size text file. Ouch! To be fair, most of the size appears to be Base64 encoded data which bloats the file size quite a bit.</p> <p><strong>Back to the question:</strong> What's the most complex data structure you've ever run into or had to program against?</p></div>
