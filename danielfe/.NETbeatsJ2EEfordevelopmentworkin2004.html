<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Do you still think .NET is &#8220;not yet?&#8220;&nbsp; </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><A href="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</A> recently published a survey of 878 North American technology decision makers asking what&nbsp;their primary development environment for 2004 will be:&nbsp;.NET or J2EE.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The answer: Overall, <STRONG>the majority of respondents,</STRONG>&nbsp;<STRONG>56%, say .NET is their primary development environment compared to 44% for J2EE</STRONG>.&nbsp; While the&nbsp;numbers vary by industry,&nbsp;business services (64% .NET vs 36% J2EE) and the public&nbsp;sector (66% .NET versus 35% J2EE) have an even more pronounced .NET advantage.&nbsp; This is pretty good considering we only shipped two years ago :)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>My personal opinion is that this research highlights the importance of interoperability across platforms and how the industry should make platform interop as painless as possible.&nbsp; If I'm a developer, I should at least&nbsp;know how to interoperate across platforms, but understanding both platforms will make me a much more valuable&nbsp;asset to my company. If you want to know how to get started interoperating across platforms, you should read the&nbsp;<A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/jdni.asp">.NET and J2EE interoperability guide</A>&nbsp;that PAG published or pick up a copy of Simon Guest's&nbsp;<A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619220/102-3513526-9890562?v=glance">.NET and J2EE Interoperability Toolkit</A>. </P>
