        Please forgive me for not blogging more, but I've been horribly sick, really busy
        and travelling.&#160; I'm only now *starting* to catch up on e-mail and remove my
        DayQuil dependency.&#160; <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/briankel">Keller </a>is
        also sick, and he was nice enough to pick&#160;me up some (generic brand) DayQuil
        last week.&#160; I personally couldn't tell the difference, but I&#160;personally
        recommend&#160;DayQuil&#160;if you ever are feeling horribly sick and can't miss work.&#160;
        Surprisingly, DayQuil&#160;only has a 3.5/5 rating (based on 46 votes)&#160;on <a href="http://www.rateitall.com/item.asp?i=08B9EF38-A4FE-4199-AAFC-6B117E70924C">rateitall</a>.&#160;
        I would've expected better.&#160; Visit rateitall for ratings on just about everything....&#160;

        I've been in New Orleans since Wednesday night of last week for Microsoft's annual
        field meeting called MGB (Microsoft Global Briefing).&#160; This is where everyone
        who works for Microsoft in the field, across the world, comes to meet and learn the
        latest sales and technical content.&#160; Maybe I've been jaded by playing too much
        Halo or <a href="http://www.xbox.com/hitman2silentassassin/default.htm?cs_catalog=cat%2dus">Hitman</a>,
        but as I was walking past a room, I noticed a&#160;session with the words "Execution
        Framework" in it and&#160;I assumed it had to do with gaming ;) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Keller (J#) , Flores (VB), and I presented on language and tool&#160;futures yesterday,
        and our session went well.&#160; Unfortunately, everything's MS confidential, but
        based on the audiences reaction, we're adding the right features to VS Whidbey and
        developers will be happy.&#160; I also presented C++ as Nick Hodapp the Product Manager
        for C++ had a prior commitment.&#160; I got to demo Vertigo's Quake 2, which has to
        be one of the more amusing things to do in a session.&#160; Vertigo ported Quake 2
        (Note: GPL) from C to C++ and compiled it in both managed and unmanaged code, by adding
        the "/clr" switch.&#160; They also added&#160;a heads-up display (HUD) written using
        C++ Managed&#160;Extensions that demonstrates how you can&#160;integrate .NET&#160;Framework
        features into a C++ application.&#160; Cool stuff!<br />
        You can find more information about the Quake 2 port <a href="http://www.vertigosoftware.com/Quake2.htm">here</a>,
        or download it <a href="http://www.notouchdeploy.net/quake2/Quake%20II%20.NET.msi">here</a>.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll write more about this trip later!
