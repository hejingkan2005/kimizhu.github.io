    <p>
        After two months on the job, today I had my first meeting with our Senior Vice President
        (and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/blogs/ericr/">blogger</a>) <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/ericr/default.asp">Eric
        Rudder</a> <em>[Note: Chris Sells also <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/#myFirstVpMeeting">blogged</a> about
        his first Eric Rudder meeting]</em>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We reviewed what the developer experience will be with the next version of C# and
        Visual Studio, and I can't tell you anything more then that&lt;g&gt;.&#160; The meeting
        went really well and everyone involved gave good, candid, feedback that really focused
        on how we can&#160;make a truly compelling experience for&#160;our core set of customers.
        I just know we're going to make a lot of developers <strong>*really*</strong> happy.
