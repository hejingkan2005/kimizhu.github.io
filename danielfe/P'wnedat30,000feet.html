<div id='content'><P>Did I mention I love <A href="http://www.scandinavian.net/">Scandinavian airlines (SAS)? </A>I *LOVE* them. I plan to fly them any time I travel across the atlantic Why? Besides being&nbsp; good airline, their fleet has been equipped with wireless internet access throughout the plane (and the <STRONG>entire </STRONG>transatlantic fleet). That's right, for $30 US you can work and surf your entire flight!! Not only that, they have full power cords, so there's no longer a need to carry a bulky power converter that's only for the plane. On the flight back, I had a 3-way IM conversation with B1 and B2 on Messenger. It was very cool if nothing more then for the novelty.</P>
<P>Back to the title of this post, I logged into <A href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</A>, a MMORPG&nbsp;and IMHO one of the top 10 games *ever*. I had some bad initial lag (being in&nbsp;<STRIKE>lag</STRIKE>IronForge didn't help) and&nbsp; I started to get a ping time around 700-2Kms. Not fast enough for Half Life 2, but good enough for rooting/nuking my way through about 5 HKs before I logged off. I'll have to post pictures of the dead...</P>
<P>If you're traveling to Europe any time soon, I highly recommend taking <A href="http://www.scandinavian.net/">SAS</A>. </P>
