<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Round 1 of voting for the Coding4Fun Redesign is over and thank you for the 120+ of you who let your opinion be known! </FONT></P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><STRONG>Special Thanks<BR></STRONG>Before we get started, I wanted to give special thanks goes out to </FONT></FONT><A href="http://www.personifydesign.com/"><FONT face=Arial size=2>Personify Design</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>, the design and development company that created these very cool designs. </FONT></P></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><STRONG>Scoring<BR></STRONG>Scoring was a little tough and I tried to be as fair as possible. If someone listed a design as "#1" I made that vote count as their vote. If someone listed design #1 or #2 and didn't list a preference between 1 or 2, I gave each a 1/2 vote. That being said, there was a clear winner in the bunch as the results show.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&lt;drum roll please&gt;</FONT></P>
