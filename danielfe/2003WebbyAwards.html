        Have you <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/main/webby_awards/nominees.html">voted</a> yet?
        You only have two more days to place your vote for the People's Choice awards!&#160;I
        love the Webby awards as they cover the coolest stuff in the&#160;web's underbelly,
        and&#160;you have to appreciate the fact that&#160;their acceptance&#160;speeches
        are limited to five words (or less).&#160;

        My predictions for this year's winners in the People's Choice awards, based on how
        much *I* use said web site, how many pieces of email I receive about said site, and
        my gut feeling: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Technical Achievement: <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> - Get Google Hacks
            the book if you haven't yet, great for Google lovers 
        </li>
        <li>
            Services: <a href="http://www.NetFlix.com">NetFlix</a> - I just recently started using
            this and it rocks! 
        </li>
        <li>
            Film: <a href="http://www.metacritic.com">Metacritic</a> - They may just win Audio
            too, based on hype, I've been using MRQE a lot lately too, but metacritic does games
            too :) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Net Art: <a href="http://www.lecielestbleu.com/puppettool">PuppetTool</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
            Print+Zines: <a href="http://www.theonion.com">The Onion</a> 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I really think they should add a category for web services, I would love to see a
        competition between <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/DevProgram/">Ebay</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html/102-2346120-4425762">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mappoint/net/">MapPoint</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/">Google</a> for the best XML Web service. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Who do you think will win this year's awards and who would win the fictitious Web
        services awards?
