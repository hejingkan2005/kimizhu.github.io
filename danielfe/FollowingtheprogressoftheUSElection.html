<div id='content'><p>I officially voted today, but I avoided the lines by using an absentee ballot. It really is the way to go.&nbsp;Someone internally sent out a link to this nice site on CNN that&nbsp;let's you track the results of the US election:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/president/">http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/president/</a></p> <p>You'll need Flash to view the map, but it gives you the state-by-state results as they come in, and you can even zoom in to see specific counties. Very cool.</p></div>
