You do what a ballet company in Roanoke, Virginia did and develop NASCAR ballet, a show where "modern dancers (who represent cars) circle a forty foot horseshoe track that banks around the corner complete with break away railings." And how do you fund such an unusual project? You follow NASCAR's lead, of course: "As the dancers gracefully careen around the track, collide and are rebuilt, logos of sponsoring companies are displayed prominently all over their bodies."&#8220;<BR></FONT></EM><FONT face=Arial size=2><BR>I brought this up during my TechEd Dallas talk, but Nascar and technical product demos have a lot in common. You don't go to high speed performance, you go to see the crashes.</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2></P></FONT></div>
