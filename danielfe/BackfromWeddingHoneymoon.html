        I'm back from Bora Bora, and I'm missing it already. The honeymoon was amazing and
        I highly recommend Bora Bora and the <a href="http://www.boraboranui.com">Bora Bora
        Nui Spa and Resort</a> to anyone considering a vacation in the south pacific. I'll
        write more details on Bora Bora later :)

        The wedding went really well, and when I came back to the office I discovered it had
        been festively decorated with streamers from the ceiling and pictures from both the
        wedding and bachelor party (I'm being "carried" in one of them) thanks to <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/briankel/">Keller</a>,
        but I plan to get him back soon enough [insert evil laugh].

        Thanks to everyone for their well wishes for the marriage/honeymoon, I'll try and
        blog later this week, but my inbox had 4K+ messages and was blocked from receiving
        mail. Gotta love Microsoft :)
