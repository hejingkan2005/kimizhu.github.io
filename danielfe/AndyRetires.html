<div id='content'><P><IMG src="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/art/csharp_team.gif" border=0> <FONT face=Arial size=2>As some of you may already know, Andy, the original C# mascot, has been retired. For most of you, especially those members of the C# team, this may come as a relief and a day that was long overdue.&nbsp; For others this news is both tragic and shocking.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The good news is that Andy has decided to retire to sunnier pastures in Mascot Hills, Florida where he will spend his time playing shuffleboard with Spuds Mackenzie, Morris the Cat, McGruff the crime-fighting dog and other mascots that want to live the good life.</FONT>
