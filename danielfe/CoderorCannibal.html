        I'm currently in sleep deprivation mode, which always&#160;reminds me&#160;of how
        Henry Rollins begins his spoken word <u>Boxed Life</u> tapes:
    </p>
    <p>
        [Henry Rollins screaming] 
        <br />
        <em>"OPEN YOUR EYES! YOUR EYES, WIDE, YOU IDIOT!"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        [In a much calmer tone] 
        <br />
        <em>"Me and the cab driver both slept the whole way to the airport."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        As I was leaving work yesterday (or early today, depending on your perspective) I
        noticed someone sleeping on the futon in the common area of our floor.&#160; I didn't
        really think anything of it, as this is about the only company where odd behavior
        late at night is pretty commonplace.&#160; The only somewhat questionable thing was
        his appearance, as Microsoft lets people dress however they want (within reason),
        and because of his tattered clothes he looked like he might be homeless,&#160;but
        I figured he was just&#160;a developer.&#160; Ari, who came in&#160;to find him this
        morning,&#160;also wondered the same thing and&#160;apparently even poked him to see
        if he was still alive (he was).&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Which, in my cognitive-deficient state, brings me to this funny site which asks the
        question - can you tell a coder from a cannibal?&#160; Its an <a href="http://www.malevole.com/mv/misc/killerquiz/">online
        test </a>to see if you can tell whether the picture you are looking at is that of
        a&#160;serial killer or a programming language inventor.&#160; This&#160;is a classic...
