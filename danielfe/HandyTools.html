        I'm still catching up on blog entries that I've been meaning to post, here are some
        of the tools I mentioned in my TechEd New Zealand sessions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>FXCop<br />
        </strong>FxCop is a tool that lets you know whether you code conforms to specific
        rules like naming guidelines, CLS compliance and much more.&#160; Just point it to
        your DLL and you'll get a list of issues with your code (You can check whether you
        want to ignore certain errors).&#160;Download <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/fxcop/">here</a>.

        <strong>ASP.NET Version Switcher<br />
        </strong>Have you ever actually tried to run ASP.NET applications that use different
        versions of the .NET Framework 1.0, 1.1, <em>and</em> Whidbey?&#160; This is totally
        possible, but it can be a pain from a configuration perspective.&#160; The issue is
        that IIS requires file extensions to be mapped to a specific ISAPI extension, so to
        have multiple virtual directories that use different versions of the framework, you
        would have to manually change the file mapping configuration for each virtual directory.
        (To do this go to IIS Manager, right click on a Virtual directory, select configuration...
        and change the file mappings).&#160; You can find more information about side-by-side
        ASP.NET support on&#160;<a href="http://www.asp.net/faq/SideBySide.aspx">ASP.NET</a>.&#160;
        I mentioned&#160;in my talk&#160;Dennis Bauer's (blog <a href="http://www.denisbauer.com/Weblog/">here</a>)&#160;<a href="http://www.denisbauer.com/NETTools/ASPNETVersionSwitcher.aspx">ASP.NET
        Version Switcher</a> that&#160;can&#160;automatically change&#160;versions for you.
        Very&#160;cool and easy tool [<a href="http://www.denisbauer.com/NETTools/ASPNETVersionSwitcher.jpg">picture</a>].&#160;

        <strong>Web Service Studio<br />
        </strong>If you find web services in <a href="http://www.uddi.org">uddi.org</a>, <a href="http://www.xmethods.net">xmethods.net</a> or&#160;<a href="http://www.salcentral.com/salnet/webserviceswsdl.asp">SalCentral</a> (which
        calls itself "<em>The Napster of Web Services"</em>), you'll find Web Service Studio&#160;to&#160;be
        the easiest way to inspect the service before you actually start writing code to it.
        Download it <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=65a1d4ea-0f7a-41bd-8494-e916ebc4159c">here</a>. 
    </p>

        <strong>CLR Profiler<br />
        </strong>If you want to know how efficiently (or inefficiently)&#160;memory is being
        used by your application, you need the CLR profiler.&#160; Here's the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/b/d/abd115c6-a96e-4d8d-b7de-9480deb6cd5c/CLRProfiler.EXE">link
        to&#160;download</a> it (its difficult to find on MSDN), and you can watch the .NET
        Show with Gregor Noriskin who walks through using the tool&#160;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20030729CLRGN/manifest.xml">here</a>.&#160;

        <strong>NetPing and SnippetCompiler</strong> 
        <br />
        Scott Hanselman who always has some awesome tools up his pocket, also recently mentioned
        two tools by Jeff Key (blog <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/Jkey/">here</a>) <a href="http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/netping/">NetPing</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href="http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/SnippetCompiler/">SnippetCompiler</a>.&#160;
        I haven't tried the SnippetCompiler (yet)&#160;but NetPing is sweet [<a href="http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/netping/netping.PNG">picture</a>].
