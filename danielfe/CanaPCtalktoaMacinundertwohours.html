        <strong>Happy Thanksgiving everybody! </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanksgiving at&#160;my mom's&#160;house in&#160;DC&#160;is a little bit non-traditional
        as guests don't arrive until around 8pm, we don't eat until close to 11pm,&#160;and
        we don't stop partying until 2/3 AM.&#160; There were about&#160;30 people at my mom's
        house this year in D.C. which made it all the more fun.<br />
        <br />
        My mother's 60th birthday also happened to fall on turkey day this&#160;year, and
        for a gift, I got her wireless speakers that&#160;plug into her PC so that she can
        listen to internet radio in the kitchen and bedroom.&#160; Worked like a charm :) 
    </p>
    <p>
        My oldest sister had been secretly recording testimonials from long-time friends and
        family to create a birthday collage for my mom.&#160;&#160;The only problem was that
        there were still pictures that&#160;we needed to add to the&#160;collage, and my sister
        uses an OS X mac laptop while I run Windows XP. Oh, and we had to do this all within
        two hours (before guests arrived) and we had to do this without my mom finding out.&#160;&#160;
        Below are the options I went through to transfer still pictures from a PC to a Mac:&#160; 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Floppy Disk - My sister didn't have hers so this was a no-go. 
        </li>
        <li>
            USB Keychain - The USB keychain that I own didn't seem to work on a Mac.&#160; This
            may be because the keychain has a password app on it that requires you to enter a
            password before you can view the files on the keychain. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Network - Network Stumbler found two wireless networks, but my sister couldn't get
            on either of these, despite our efforts.&#160; XP got on both of these networks&#160;without
            any problems.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            IR Port - Her laptop lacked an IR port. 
        </li>
        <li>
            CD-ROM Burning - This was the last option that I could think of, as my laptop is a
            DVD-CD/RW combo I could burn a disk for her pretty easily.&#160; Unfortunately we
            didn't have blank CD-Rs at my house, so I ran to the local grocery store (the only
            thing open on turkey day) and found blank CD-Rs &lt;aside&gt;Back when I first started
            burning disks in '98, the only place you could ever find blank CDs was in computer
            stores, now you can find them in grocery stores&lt;/aside&gt;. After sneaking these
            into our house, I ran upstairs only to discover that I didn't have CD burning software,
            and&#160;after trashing&#160;a disk&#160;trying to get Windows Media Player to act
            as a burner, I started searching the web for burning software.&#160; That's when I
            remembered that&#160;<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/">Duncan</a>&#160;had
            posted <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/c/69c5d1b7-e3ac-4986-99f1-0c55dc374d66/xpburn.msi">Anson's&#160;CD
            burning code</a>. I downloaded the MSI and installed it.&#160; It's a very easy to
            use, well-factored API, and below is the actual code I used to burn files to the CD
            burner (with inserted comments to explain what's going on) 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <font face="courier">&#160;<font color="#008000" size="3">//Create a new instance

    </font></b><font size="3">&#160;</font>With the code written, I placed it in&#160;a
    button click event of a Windows form and presto, it worked!&#160; My sister took the
    freshly burned CD and was able to read the pictures off the disk with no problem.&#160;
    My mom loved the&#160;video montage&#160;and there was much rejoicing.&#160;
