        Today is George Conard's last day at Microsoft :(
    </p>
    <p>
        George is/was a Program Manager on the C# team who was responsible for several things
        including Whidbey planning (where I worked with him closely) and academia.&#160; He
        will be missed, but the good news is that he has started <a href="http://www.georgeconard.com/blog/">blogging</a>,
        so we'll be able to follow his adventures wherever they take him.&#160;
