He walks through creating a client GUI end-to-end using Mono including designing the architecture, using </FONT><A href="http://www.db4o.com/community/"><FONT face=Arial size=2>db4objects </FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>for&nbsp;persistence, and <A href="http://www.nunit.org">nUnit </A>for unit tests.

<P><EM><FONT face=Arial size=2>How I Went Mono<BR>In the last 5-6 years I've been working on the Java/J2EE platform, delivering enterprise applications for various customers. By "enterprise" I mean applications which have to accomodate a large number of concurrent users, have to integrate with various legacy back-end services, have to fit an end-to-end architecture envisioned by the customer, and has to be manageable and configurable in a consistent, straight-forward way. I have found Java and J2EE the perfect platform for this. While there has been a bit of a backlash against the perceived complexity of the various frameworks associated with J2EE, I think the enterprise space with its inherent constraints is really an area which benefited the most from the pluggable, scalable, and manageable aspects of the Java stack.<BR></FONT></EM></P>
