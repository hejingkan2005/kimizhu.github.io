        After 3 hours of sleep (re - broken demos) I woke up to hit the Convention Center
        in Dallas.&#160; I finally met <a href="http://www.microsoftregionaldirectors.com/Extranet/DirectorDetails.aspx?did=1146">Juval</a> in
        person while checking in at registration, and I think there are about 5 cardboard
        cutouts of Juval around all of TechEd.&#160; More on that later.&#160; My first presentation
        was to faculty and you can find out more information about it on <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/morriss/PermaLink.aspx/f8a5b8cc-dba6-4e05-ad20-4e007c3d5b10">Morris's</a> blog,
        and also what happenned to me minutes before I spoke on <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/briankel/PermaLink.aspx/51056c03-c1df-4ca5-8f05-8bdcb8626fee">Brian's</a> log.&#160;
        My laptop has since recovered.&#160; After this I gave a quick talk to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/rd/">RD</a>'s
        on generics which was fun (I like these people), and then hit the Circle Ranch afterwards.&#160;
        After some good barbeque and a <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/briankel/PermaLink.aspx/bc708744-de59-4e9a-b5ab-8b0b3f6e3681">shooting</a>,
        I got to meet a lot of cool people in the community and even met and drink with <a href="http://www.drewby.net">Drew</a> who
        runs <a href="http://www.techedbloggers.net">TechEdBloggers</a> in person.&#160;&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of TechEdBloggers, the bloggers&#160;meeting is tonight from 7-8pm in Room
        A118. Be there :) 
    </p>
    <p>
        The rest of the night is under NDA, but I now know that people from Dallas, Microsoft,
        and event attendees know how to have a good time:)
