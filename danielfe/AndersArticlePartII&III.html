        Bill Venners has released <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs.html">Part
        II</a> and <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/simplexity.html">Part III </a>of his
        interview series with Anders Hejlsberg on the C# Language Design Process.&#160; There's
        some great discussion on topics such as&#160;why C# does not have&#160;checked exceptions
        like Java, simplicity versus simplexity, <em>the beauty of delegates </em>[my words],
        and explaining how C# is&#160;classified as a&#160;component-oriented language.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of component-oriented programming, &#160;one of the things that has definitely
        chanaged is the approach to programming.&#160; Rather then creating one big monolothic
        application, applications are divided into multiple&#160;components.&#160; In fact,
        one could argue that programming the .NET framework is less about writing code from
        scratch but instead the process is really about linking&#160;pre-built components&#160;to
        achieve a specific task.&#160;&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        For those of you attending <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc">PDC</a>&#160;this
        year, Anders will be presenting&#160;the Visual C# "Whidbey": Language Enhancements
        session :)
    </p>
