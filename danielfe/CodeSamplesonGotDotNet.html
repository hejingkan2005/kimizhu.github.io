        The code samples I demoed during my TechEd Middle-Tier apps with C# session have finally
        been uploaded onto GotDotNet.&#160; Each sample has a readme.txt file which should
        give you more information for how to setup and run the samples.&#160;

        #1 - Basic Serialization</a> 
        <br />
        </strong>The first sample is a very basic sample which shows how to return objects
        through web services, how to shape XML through attributes, and returning data through
        a DataSet in a web service.

        #2a - Binary Web Service</a> 
        <br />
        </strong>This sample shows how to return binary data, like an image, by using two
        different techniques, Base64 encoding and Direct Internet Message Encapsulation (available
        in WSE 1.0).&#160; Because this sample can be&#160;might be difficult to explain,
        I've added a pretty picture:

        #2b - File Upload through a Binary Web Service</a> 
        <br />
        </strong>While ASP.NET made it much easier to upload files to a server when compared
        to classic ASP, I always found it really annoying to have to upload one file at a
        time.&#160; To solve this, I created a web service that accepts an array of&#160;
        (custom) file objects,&#160;consisting of a file name and an array of bytes Base64
        encoded.&#160; This upload web service can now be used by a variety of&#160;clients&#160;including
        Java applications for example.&#160; To show the power of no-touch deployment, I used
        a Windows control with a label. When you&#160;drag-and-drop files over the label,&#160;the
        cursor changes to a "+" symbol, and if you release the mouse,&#160;the&#160;files
        are sent as an array of objects and uploaded onto a directory on the web service all
        at once.&#160; I have a couple of thoughts on how I can improve this, including asynchronous
        upload with a status bar, FTP upload, and a dynamic client/server tree-view, but I
        just didn't have time.&#160;&#160;I've included an&#160;explaining what's going on
        below:

        #3 Windows Services</a> 
        <br />
        </strong>The first sample shows how to use the FileSystemWatcher class in a Windows
        service to monitor a directory and log all file changes, renames, deletes into the
        Event Log.&#160; It also includes a Windows Service installer which shows how to install
        a Windows Service.&#160; The other sample shows how to start and stop a&#160;windows
        service directly from a mobile device (cell phone, RIM, etc)&#160;through an&#160;ASP.NET
        mobile web application. Relevant Resources:

        #4 ASP.NET Cache in DAL</a></strong> 
        <br />
        This sample shows how you can leverage the powerful features of the ASP.NET cache
        directly in a middle tier Data Access Layer (DAL)&#160;by using the ASP.NET cache
        API. The DAL has two methods, one which retrieves using ASP.NET cache and the other
        without.&#160; To exaggerate the speed differences, I also made both threads go to
        sleep for 1000 milliseconds when they hit the database and ran simple ACT scripts
        against both pages.&#160; Relevant Resources:
