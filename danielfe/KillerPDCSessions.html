Get a tour of Interactive Designer, and then walk over how features are used to build a UI. </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><B>IE 7: What's New in IE</B><BR>Internet Explorer is an essential part of Microsoft platform, providing functionality that both Web developers and Windows developers rely on for their solutions.

<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><B>IIS 7: A Lap around IIS 7</B><BR>IIS 7 makes developing, deploying and configuring Web applications easier then ever before. In this overview session, we demo all of the key changes in IIS 7 that impact developers. Come see how the new componentized Web server architecture enables you to not only add or remove modules in IIS to customize it for a particular application, but replace IIS modules with your own. Learn how the new configuration system makes distributed configuration of IIS settings possible, and allows Web developers to XCopy IIS configuration, along with content, to remote servers. Get a first glance at the brand new, rich graphical UI, which enables remote (over HTTP) management and configuration of applications.

<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><B>Longhorn: Building RSS Enabled Applications</B><BR>Longhorn adds support for RSS (Really Simple Syndication). The RSS functionality in Longhorn is being designed to make it simple for end users to discover, view and subscribe to RSS feeds, as well as make it easier for developers to incorporate the rich capabilities of RSS into their applications. In addition, the RSS functionality includes Simple List Extensions, a set of extensions to RSS that can be used to enable Web sites to publish lists such as of photo albums, music playlists and top 10 lists as RSS feeds. Come see multiple examples of subscription-enabled applications built on the RSS APIs. Security safeguards are also explained. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><B>Longhorn: Developing for Test Automation and Accessibility Using Programmatic Access to UI</B><BR>In this session, we show you the rich set of classes for controlling and driving Avalon applications. UI Automation (UIA) provides a single model for programmatic access allowing automated tests to interact with the UI and assistive technologies to expose UI information to end users. Provider-side interfaces allow developers to plug their object model into UIA tree exposing property information/firing events and implementing control patterns. Client-side interfaces support automated testing through querying the tree structure/discovering UI elements, determining control functionality, driving a control and calling control-independent methods. </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><B>The .NET Language Integrated Query Framework: An Overview</B><BR>Modern applications operate on data in several different forms: Relational tables, XML documents, and in-memory objects. Each of these domains have profound differences in semantics, data types, and capabilities, and much of the complexity in today's applications is the result of these mismatches. The "Orcas" release of Visual Studio aims to unify the programming models through integrated query capabilities in C# and Visual Basic, a strongly typed data access framework, and an innovative API for manipulating and querying XML. This session introduces each of these areas and walks through how they are related.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><B>Using the .NET Language Integrated Query Framework with Relational Data</B><BR>Database-centric applications have traditionally had to rely on two distinct programming languages: one for the database and one for the application. This session introduces advances Microsoft is making for the "Orcas" release of Visual Studio in programming languages and frameworks to help integrate relational data and queries with C# and Visual Basic. These advances enable developers to express queries and updates in terms of their local programming language without sacrificing the server-side execution model of today's high-performance SQL-based approaches. Using these advances, database queries that previously were stored as opaque strings now benefit from static type checking, CLR metadata, design-time type inference, and of course IntelliSense.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><B>Using the .NET Language Integrated Query Framework with XML Data</B><BR>One of the key challenges to working with XML data has been the impedance mismatch between XML and programming languages. This session introduces advances Microsoft is making for the "Orcas" release of Visual Studio in programming languages and frameworks to help integrate XML and queries with C# and Visual Basic. The advances include a framework for navigating, querying, and transforming XML that is both easier to use and more efficient than current XML programming techniques. This framework marries the capabilities of XPath, XQuery, and the DOM with the language integrated query framework planned for C# and Visual Basic. </FONT></FONT></P></div>
