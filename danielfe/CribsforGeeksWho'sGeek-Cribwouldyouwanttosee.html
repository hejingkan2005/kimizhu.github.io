<div id='content'><p>Jeff Sandquist <a href="http://www.jeffsandquist.com/MicrosoftEmployeesShowUsYourHome.aspx">is looking for potential Microsoft employees</a> who wouldn't mind showing how they've pimped their house with technology like X10, Windows Media Center, Windows Home Server, and more.</p>  <p>This is an awesome idea and it rocks that Jeff and team are doing this. Amusingly, I dug up an old email from June, 2004 with Jeff and I talking about doing this, but he wouldn't be able to until July because he was slammed. wanted to get <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaybaz">Jay Bazuzi</a> to do this given that before Windows Home Server, he had a crazy home network with multiple domain controllers.</p>  <p>&#xA0;</p>  <p>So, besides Bill Gates' house (which has its own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates%27_house">Wikipedia article</a>), who's <em>Geek-Crib </em>would you want to see? These are in no particular order</p>  <ul>   <li><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/jallard/default.mspx">J Allard</a></strong> - I bet he has a really, really nice home theater system </li>    <li><strong><a href="http://blogs.msn.com/ericgu">Eric Gunnerson</a> </strong>- I'd save this for the holidays for when Eric has his lights up. Eric also had hacked his Pocket PC into a remote control</li>    <li><strong>Craig Symonds </strong>- <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel">Brian Keller</a> had tried to get Craig to let us tape his house as he has a home automation hookup, but I don't think it ever happened</li>    <li><strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaybaz">Jay Bazuzi</a> </strong>- Jay's always tinkering with cool stuff and is one of the go-to folks for Windows Home Server. </li>    <li><strong><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a> </strong>- Well, because he's Scott :)</li>    <li><strong><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a></strong> - Back in 2004, Scott and I talked about a <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b833aaa4-6270-4ddd-9752-4b5fbdccb62e">similar idea</a> about doing a &quot;Tech Eye for the Regular Guy&quot; where we give you a total <em>Geek makeover</em> with Media Center, Xbox, Home Theater, you name it. Scott's apparently got a killer setup now too, can't wait to see that video</li>    <li><strong><a href="http://www.betterthaneveryone.com/">Clint Rutkas</a> </strong>- Is there any doubt the guy that could turn his apartment into a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2006/11/01/918683.aspx">Disco Dance Floor</a> wouldn't have a bad-ass pad? Well Clint did recently move so maybe in a few months :)</li> </ul>  <p>&#xA0;</p>  <p><strong>Non-Microsoft Folks Cribs</strong></p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.brianpeek.com"><strong>Brian Peek</strong></a> - If his house has even some of the cool stuff he's written about on Coding4Fun, then this should be a fun demo</li>    <li><a href="http://makezine.com/blog/"><strong>Phil Torrone</strong></a> - Phil's always working on fun, cool projects on Make and of course <a href="http://www.artofoffice.com/PowerPoint/Illegal-Prime">art work</a> that would make for an interesting tour</li>    <li><strong><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood</a></strong> - If his crib is anywhere near as cool as his <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000905.html">PC-making</a> skills, this would definitely be an interesting video      <br /></li> </ul>  <blockquote>   <h4>&quot;Who's crib do you want to see?&quot;</h4> </blockquote>  <p>PS - I still think we should do Tech Eye for the Regular Guy - Send Scott, Clint, Brian </p>  <p>PPS - Hanselman's caption from this <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/CIMG1716_20_28Small_29.JPG">photo</a> of our '04 conversation cracked me up: <em>Right to Left: Bill Evjen (Reuters and countless books, including one on WSE and ASP.NET 2.0 Beta), Ari Bixhorn, the Adam Sandler of Group Program Management, and Dan Fernandez.&#xA0; <strong>One day we will all co-host Saturday Night Live together.</strong></em></p></div>
