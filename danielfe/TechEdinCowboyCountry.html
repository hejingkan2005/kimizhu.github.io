    <p>
        Next week is TechEd and I'm&#160;really excited and just a bit overwhelmed.&#160;&#160;I
        was also a&#160;little afraid of going into Cowboy country as I used to call the DC
        area home and I'm a Redskins fan, but luckily there are a fair number of us current
        and former Redskins both presenting and attending.&#160; I also used to live in Austin
        (loved it thanks for asking) and&#160;people from Texas are really friendly so I'm
        not too scared.&#160;&#160;We have a ton of stuff going on for developers and I always
        find the toughest part being choosing what sessions to attend.&#160; So without further
        ado, here are my pics for sessions and events: 
    </p>
    <p>

            on Monday night from 7-8PM in room 118A.&#160; If you blog and you're attending TechEd,
            come join the fun and/or the after party!&#160; We may also be able to get a blogging
            room with wireless access so keep <a href="http://www.techedbloggers.net">checking</a> for

        </li>
        <li>
            Come Hang with the C# team on Wednesday night from 7-8pm in room 118A. We'll probably
            go out for drinks this night too... 
        </li>
        <li>
            We're also presenting to the Dallas .NET User Group Thursday night&#160;from 6-9pm&#160;at
            the Microsoft office. Click <a href="<a">here</a> for directions, and the official&#160;TechEd
            party is this night, so&#160;join-in and have fun. 
        </li>
        <li>
            While this isn't really a cool event per se, the <a href="http://www.mymsevents.com/MyMSEvents/Content.Aspx?p=HOL.htm">Hands-on
            labs</a> are IMHO the best way to learn .NET concepts you might not be familiar with.&#160;

        as many sessions as I would like.&#160; What sessions are you planning to attend?
