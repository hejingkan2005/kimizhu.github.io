<div id='content'><p>After spending three years here, our team is moving from Building 42 to Building 17. I really liked Building 42, besides being more modern,&nbsp;the 42 dwellers seem to be much more in-touch. For example, Bldg 42 housed many well-known bloggers like <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">Chris Anderson</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/">Soma</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a>, <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/">Don Box</a>, among&nbsp;others, and&nbsp;I frankly don't know any Buiding 17 bloggers (give a shout out if you see this). My only complaint about Building 42 was the damn COM+ lab with whom I've battled way too many times with contuously-beeping power surge hardware. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Random Stuff in my office<br></strong>Why is you&nbsp;never realize how much <strike>junk</strike> stuff you have until you pack it? &nbsp;Here are some of the gems that I found in my office:</p> <ul> <li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bad-Hair-James-Innes-Smith/dp/1582343292/sr=8-1/qid=1166116768/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7127103-7243165?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Bad Hair</a>&nbsp;Book</li> <li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Hell-Miriam-Van-Scott/dp/0312244428/sr=1-1/qid=1166116887/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7127103-7243165?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Encyclopedia of Hell</a> - This should be required reading for cube dwellers to properly categorize evil co-workers and to know what level of hell you are in during a project.</li> <li>A miniature tiki god from Bora Bora</li> <li>An <a href="http://www.buyinitechmugs.com/">Initech Mug</a></li> <li>A&nbsp;McDonald's Happy Meal Monster Toy that glows in the dark when you pull its arms</li> <li>A Fart Alarm Detector</li> <li>A C# Shot Glass</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>What random stuff do you have in your office?</p></div>
