<div id='content'><p>As a dogfooder who tried Windows the Vista Beta, man has this product come a long way. Kudos to the Windows team for dramatically improving just about everything in the product. </p> <p>Here's some key things to remember:</p> <p><strong>Backup your files</strong> - Always good advice, but don't forget to export your IE Favorites and your OPML blog roll from your favorite blog reader before starting.</p> <p><strong>My PC</strong>:&nbsp;Dell XPS M170 (pre dual-core), 2GB RAM, 80 GB Hard drive. </p> <p><strong>My Installation List</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/editions/ultimate.mspx">Windows Vista Ultimate Edition</a>  <li>Visual Studio 2005 Team Suite  <li>SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition  <li>Visual Studio Express&nbsp;- <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/support/windowsvista/">Full support information here</a>  <li>Windows Live Messenger  <li>WinZip 9 SR1  <li>Windows Live Writer Beta  <li>Visual Studio Team System  <li>Mezer Tools - Screen Capture  <li>iTunes  <li>Firefox  <li>Adobe Reader  <li>Office 2007 - I love Office 2007, killer app  <li>Office 2007 Add-in (Save as PDF or XPS)  <li>New York Times WPF Reader  <li>Expression Web  <li>Windows Grep  <li>Digital Image Suite 2006 <li>Ventrillo <li>World of Warcraft</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Other Personal Notes</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>UAC can be annoying: </strong>But you can turn it off by clicking on your user account, selecting personalize and turning it off. This is a personal decision everyone needs to go through, but I'm thankful there's an option to turn it off.  <li><strong>Everything is both new and familiar</strong>: That may sound like a contradiction, but while there's a lot that's new in the operating system, I don't feel lost and I can intuitively figure out where things are. In that sense, I don't see customers getting "lost" in Vista.  <li><strong>What doesn't work</strong>: RSS Bandit - I've already pinged Dare, I'l let you know what I hear back  <li><strong>It's Faster</strong>: World of Warcraft performance is faster than on Windows XPSP2 both in terms of frames/second and the feeling of responsiveness. Unexpected but cool :) <li><strong>What Driver didn't work: </strong>My Sierra Wireless AirCard 860 didn't "just work", but luckily the good folks at Sierra Wireless do have <a href="http://www.sierrawireless.com/support/sd_acxxx_step2.aspx?ac_id=5&amp;carrier_id=13&lang;_id=1&amp;platform_id=1">Windows Vista drivers</a>, but make sure to download the (almost hidden) option #2. The first option is for Cingular's weak-sauce software while the second is Sierra's driver. Use the second one.  <li><strong>Favorite secret feature so far</strong>: Intelligent copy and paste. When I copied over&nbsp;my old machine's Windows XP "My Documents", it recognized the structure and asked me to move things like "My Music" or "My Pictures" to the new folder structure (C:\Users\Danielfe\Music or C:\Users\Danielfe\Pictures)  <li><strong>Favorite keyboard shortcut</strong>: From <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2006/09/20/19457.aspx">Peter's blog</a>, hit Windows Key+N to launch apps in your quick launch, Windows Key+1 launches the first app, Win+2 launches the second, and so on  <li><strong>Full list of Windows Vista shortcuts</strong>: <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/2503b91d-d780-4c80-8f08-2f48878dc5661033.mspx">Can be found here</a>  <li><strong>PowerShell looks cool</strong>: The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2CFDFF65-6AE2-4322-A31A-B5EC76E871F5&amp;displaylang=en">version listed here</a> is in fact the RTM 1.0 version, the team just needs to update the labels. </li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All-in-all, I think users will be pleasantly surprised by Vista and the sky is not actually falling. </p></div>
