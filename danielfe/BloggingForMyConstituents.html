        One of my most important constituents, the Mrs. says that I haven't blogged about
        her enough.&#160; <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/bgold/">Goldfarb</a>&#160;shares
        his wisdom that I can either spend time with her or blog about her.&#160; I agree,
        but occasionally I'll find cool stuff that will help simplify her life (I complicate
        it a bit so anything that helps is a good thing).&#160; This sounds too cool to not
        share:&#160;

        <strong>Nail Color at the flick of a switch</strong> from the <a href="http://www.news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=1238792003">Scotsman</a>

        <em>"WOMEN will soon be able to change the colour of their nails at the click of a
        switch. Researcher Carlos Gonzalez has been working on an electrochromic false nail
        at the Cidetec research centre in Spain' s Basque country. The hi-tech cosmetic accessory
        is fitted on top of the natural nail and, once in place, can be changed to the colour
        of the wearer's choice. The nail is made up of a number of superimposed layers, which
        are sandwiched between various electrochromic polymers to allow the colours to change.</em>"
