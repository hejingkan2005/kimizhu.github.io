<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Arial size=2>I just ran across <A href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=2af18ecb-e381-4f5c-bb51-f469920019a5">Harry Pierson&#8217;s post on Ted Leonsis</A>, the owner of the Washington Capitals, and I completely agree with him.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It&#8217;s tough being a Washington Capitals fan, it really is.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>The Capitals this year seem bent on self destruction. This year alone they traded Jaromir Jagr, their #1 goal scorer in &#8217;02-03 season, Robert Lang, their #2 goal scorer in &#8217;02-&#8217;03 (and when traded was the #1 scorer in the entire NHL), Peter Bondra, an original Washington draftee, who finished scoring in the top 5 every season since 1994, and set <STRONG>franchise records </STRONG>for points (825), goals (472), power-play goals (137), power-play goals/season (22), game-winning goals (73), shorthanded goals (32) short-handed goals/season (6), game-winning goals (13), hat tricks (19), hat tricks/season (4), goals/game (5), <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>and goals/period (4). </FONT></P>
