<div id='content'><P>* Update: fixed wrong hyperlink&nbsp;</P>
<P>On Friday, an alert reader emailed me about a <A class="" href="http://www.bluej.org/mrt/?p=21" mce_href="http://www.bluej.org/mrt/?p=21">new article by Michael K<EM>ö</EM>lling</A>, the creator of BlueJ, about a patent issued by Microsoft for&nbsp;features in Object Test Bench that are comparable to BlueJ's Object Bench.&nbsp;I'll post the full "anatomy of a firedrill" some time later, but for now we can officially say that the <STRONG>patent application was a mistake and one that should not have happened. To fix this, Microsoft will be removing the patent application in question</STRONG>. Our sincere apologies to Michael Kölling and the BlueJ community.</P>
<P>In addition, our Product Unit Manager is investigating&nbsp;how this happened to begin...Again my apologies to Michael, but I'm glad in the end we did the right thing.</P>
