        Probably one of the most religious issues for developers (at least those using the
        same platform and programming language) is bracing style.&#160; There are several
        styles available, with the two most popular being K&amp;R style &amp; Allman style.&#160;
        I found this nice description on the different indent styles <a href="http://www.wkonline.com/d/indent_style.html">here</a>,
        and pasted the different indentation styles below:
    </p>
    <p>
        <em><strong>'K&amp;R style' </strong>-- Named after Kernighan &amp; Ritchie, because
        the examples<br />
        in K&amp;R are formatted this way. Also called `kernel style' because the<br />
        Unix kernel is written in it, and the `One True Brace Style' (abbrev.<br />
        1TBS) by its partisans. In C code, the body is typically indented by<br />
        eight spaces (or one tab) per level, as shown here. Four spaces are<br />
        occasionally seen in C, but in C++ and Java four tends to be the rule<br />
        rather than the exception.<br />
        &#160; 
        <br />
        if () {&#160;&#160;<br />
        &#160;&#160;&#160; 
        <br />
        <strong>'Allman style'</strong> -- Named for Eric Allman, a Berkeley hacker who wrote
        a<br />
        lot of the BSD utilities in it (it is sometimes called `BSD style').<br />
        Resembles normal indent style in Pascal and Algol. It is the only style<br />
        other than K&amp;R in widespread use among Java programmers. Basic indent per level
        shown here is eight spaces, but four (or sometimes three)<br />
        spaces are generally preferred by C++ and Java programmers.<br />
        &#160; 
        <br />
        if ()<br />
        {&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br />
        &#160;<br />
        <strong>'Whitesmiths style'</strong> -- popularized by the examples that came with<br />
        Whitesmiths C, an early commercial C compiler. Basic indent per level<br />
        shown here is eight spaces, but four spaces are occasionally seen.<br />
        &#160; 
        <br />
        if ()<br />
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; {&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br />
        &#160;&#160;&#160; 
        <br />
        <strong>'GNU style' </strong>-- Used throughout GNU EMACS and the Free Software<br />
        Foundation code, and just about nowhere else. Indents are always four<br />
        spaces per level, with `{' and `' halfway between the outer and inner<br />
        indent levels.<br />
        &#160; 
        <br />
        if ()<br />
        &#160; {<br />
        <br />
        </em>My "religious" preference is definitely Allman style, but from what I understand
        authors tend to prefer K&amp;R so that they don't lose precious book space when printing
        source.&#160; The cool thing is that Whidbey lets you format your code and use whatever
        indentation style you prefer (there's 60+ other choices you can make to format your
        code).&#160; What style do you use, and are you religious about it?&#160; Say you
        found a sample on a web site that used a different bracing style, would you change
        the bracing style before running the app? I would, but only if I were planning on
        keeping the code...
