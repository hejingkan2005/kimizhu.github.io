<div id='content'><p>Since I'm a Visual Studio fanboy, I love hearing about the future of Visual Studio, now officially named Visual Studio 2010.&#160; While the team is taking a measured approach to disclosure, something they haven't done in VS 2005/2008, I did get the scoop on the future of Visual Studio Team System with Norman Guadagno, the Director of Product Management on what the key themes are for this release. </p>  <p>&#160;</p> <iframe src="https://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Dan/429924/player/" frameborder="0" width="320" scrolling="no" height="325"></iframe>  <br /><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Dan/Norman-Guadagno-Announcing-Visual-Studio-Team-System-2010/">Norman Guadagno: Announcing Visual Studio Team System 2010</a>  <br />  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>There's a lot more coming and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel">Brian Keller</a> from Channel 9 has a ton more videos coming this week with demos all week long on the <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9 Visual Studio site</a>.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h3>Video Schedule</h3>  <p><strong>Architecture Day</strong> (Tuesday, September 30th):    <br />- Overview from Cameron Skinner    <br />- UML designers    <br />- &quot;Top-down design&quot;    <br />- &quot;Bottom-up design&quot;    <br /><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Business Alignment </strong>(Wednesday, October 1st):    <br />- Overview from Lori Lamkin and Stephanie Saad    <br />- Agile project planning and reporting    <br />- Enterprise project management    <br /></p> <strong></strong>  <p><strong>Software Quality</strong> (Thursday, October 2nd):    <br />- Overview from James Whittaker    <br />- Test Case Management    <br />- Manual Test Runner    <br />- Historical Debugger    <br />- Impact Analysis    <br /><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Team Foundation Server </strong>(Friday, October 3rd):    <br />- Overview from Brian Harry    <br />- Branching and merging visualization    <br />- Enterprise Team Foundation Server Management    <br />- Team Foundation Server Setup    <br />- Migration &amp; Synchronization    <br />- Team Build</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>While the team is primarily discussing Visual Studio Team System now, as Norman alludes to, you can expect to hear about a whole slew of new features at the <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com">Professional Developer's Conference</a> in October, and some more at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/emea/teched2008/developer/default.aspx">TechEd Europe 2008</a> in November.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>What about bits?      <br /></strong>Unfortunately the team hasn't released any public bits that you can play with to try these features hands on. </p></div>
