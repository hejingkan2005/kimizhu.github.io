<div id='content'><p></p> <p>If you're a Coding4Fun reader, please respond! <p>&nbsp; <p>Earlier this week, I asked our Coding4Fun authors what they thought about moving Coding4Fun to being fully blog-based a la <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a>, <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/">Make</a>, etc.  <p>Many Coding4Fun readers don't know this, but Coding4Fun actually uses <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/">http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/</a> as its back-end blog engine and the MSDN presence at <a href="http:///msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/">http:///msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/</a> &nbsp;is really a “skin” if you will of that engine. Rather than having two sites, we’re considering on moving solely to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun">http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun</a>&nbsp;with our msdn site still existing but it would just redirect to the blog. &nbsp; <p>&nbsp; <p>Why do this? <p>&nbsp; <p><strong>Advantages of moving to primarily a blog option</strong></p> <ul> <li>Built-in C4F only search so you can actually find articles</li> <li>No formatting weirdness between sites where code looks good on the blog, but crappy on the MSDN site</li> <li>No more disappearing articles where old articles can't&nbsp;be found because they are no longer visible through the RSS feed</li> <li>Deeper categorization/tags – we can provide a much more thorough list of tags than we do today</li> <li>Built-in comments so you can share your thoughts on articles</li> <li>Easier to find in search engines </li> <li>Less work for authors to publish </li> <li>Version resilience – MSDN is moving to an new infrastructure that would tie up our dev resources</li> <li>We would still have article redirection in place for previously published articles that would point to the blog</li> <li>Printer-friendly articles, assuming we stick to some high-level authoring guidelines</li></ul> <p><strong>Disadvantages of moving to primarily a blog option</strong></p> <ul> <li>Less control over the UI Frame – It may not be as “sexy” a UI, although we’ll likely be able to get a custom blog skin</li> <li>Article URLs would be on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com">http://blogs.msdn.com</a> instead of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a> </li></ul> <p>&nbsp; <p>Let me know what you think!</p></div>
