        Semi-random stream of consciousness...

        <strong>Halo</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/csharp/team/ericgu/default.aspx">EricGu</a> turned
        me onto <a href="http://www.redvsblue.com">Red vs. Blue</a> while&#160;we were at
        the speaker lounge at TechEd and I started having uncontrollable fits of laughter
        in what <em>was</em> a quiet room.&#160; They're making 22 episodes, so make sure
        to donate to the cause.&#160; If you're a Halo fan this is an absolute must see.&#160;&#160;It's
        a movie filmed entirely inside of Halo&#160;with a well&#160;written and executed
        storyline.&#160; One of the best things I've seen on the net in a while!&#160;&#160;

        <strong>H4x0rs</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.insecure.org">Insecure</a> recently polled a NMap (of Matrix2
        fame) mailing list to see what they list members thought were&#160;the Top <a href="http://www.insecure.org/tools.html">75
        security tools</a>, excluding NMap of course.&#160; There are quite a bit of tools
        I wasn't familiar with, but I thought I would pass this along as a good addition to
        your&#160;bookmarks for security tools.

        <strong>Life of Blogosphere stories</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>&#160;</em>Interesting <a href="http://www.microdoc-news.info/blogger/2003/05/20.html#a636">read</a> on
        the circle of life and evolution of blog postings, but the sample size does seem a
        bit small for accurate scientific study. In Microdoc's own words "<em>Through a study
        of 45 blogosphere stories, Microdoc News has developed a picture of how a blogosphere
        story gets started, how that story develops and then how it then comes to an end.
        While each blogosphere story has its own pattern of development, the similarities
        between one story and another is intriguingly similar. The smallest blogosphere stories
        can have as few as fifteen bloggers, the average story has between 40 and 60 bloggers,
        while the largest one to date had about 285 bloggers involved. A blogosphere story
        can be as small as 180 posts in total, while the largest we studied has numbered 7,540
        posts in total."&#160;</em>The even post a pretty picture to&#160;explain the&#160;connections
        between blog stories. I'm not sure what it means, but it looks like a complex version
        of the classic "flea flicker" call.<br />
