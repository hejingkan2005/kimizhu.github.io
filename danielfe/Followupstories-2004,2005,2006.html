There are, of course, those that continue to perpetuate the myth (you know who you are, sweating in bed at night, miserable yet too proud to admit that you're miserable). </FONT></P>

<P><EM><FONT face=Arial size=2>Amen Dan. I've lived in Seattle for six years with my wife (a fellow blue badge) and we tried to live the lie, but this year I think we're gonna break down and get a/c installed. &nbsp;I work in a home office and you are 100% on target; our uber-insulated house bakes at 80 degrees all day long and it's a cooker inside by 5pm, so much so that halfway through the day I'm packing up the laptop heading for the nearest air conditioned coffee shop. Moreover, the house gets to a peak 81/82 degrees inside and won't cool off to 70 degrees until 4am the next morning, just in time for the sun to come up and start baking it again. </FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
