        As <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/ericgu/PermaLink.aspx/41d80e18-0661-491e-a54c-51a75fb77d13">Eric </a>points
        out, on Wednesday <a href="http://mindview.net/WebLog">Bruce Eckel</a>&#160;and <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=bv">Bill
        Venners</a> came on campus to talk to members of the C# team.&#160; They interviewed <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg">Anders</a>&#160;for
        a recently published&#160;<a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/csdes.html">article</a>&#160;(Bill)&#160;as
        well as a series of interviews with industry luminaries (Bruce) that will be made
        available on CD-ROM.&#160; I'm hoping to get the audio from the interview and place
        it on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/">MSDN </a>for anyone interested.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I should also now mention how cool it is to work with the C# team, and how it can
        be difficult at times to not spontaneously avert my eyes, bow, and start chanting
        "I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy" during meetings.&#160; &#160; 
        <br />
        Anders isn't what I&#160;would've expected...he's a really nice guy, he's funny, he's
        not socially awkward (a rarity for engineers), he's well versed in a variety of topics,
        and he's someone that can comfortably present to either a room full of CEO's or hardcore
        engineers. He basically rocks, and I'm glad he works for MS and not our competitors
        :)

        As a newbie to the team, it was&#160;enlightening&#160;to hear the ins-and-outs of
        the&#160;language design process and the choices the team had to make when first designing
        C#.&#160; I&#160;noticed some&#160;general themes that arose during the language design
        process discussion, like simplicity, elegance, and&#160;actual value&#160;and I then
        became cognizant of just how obvious they are in the language, and also how difficult
        making those design decisions must be.&#160; You&#160;too can hear&#160;all about,
        and I'll blog&#160;with a link to the audio once its on MSDN.&#160;
