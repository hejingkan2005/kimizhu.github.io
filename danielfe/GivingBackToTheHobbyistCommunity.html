<P>Back in 1975, Microsoft started out as <STRONG>*the*</STRONG> hobbyist company for a nascient software industry. While many things have changed since then, we always had a special place in our hearts for hobbyists. In 2005, we're going to make sure to&nbsp;give a lot of love back to&nbsp;our true roots - the &nbsp;hobbyist&nbsp;community. </P>
<P><STRONG>Announcing the Coding4Fun Web Site on MSDN</STRONG></P>
