<P>Today we announced TwitterDrive, a free, <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2009/04/01/9525376.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2009/04/01/9525376.aspx">open source application</A> that will revolutionize cloud storage and cloud applications as we know it.&nbsp; Here is an interview with the <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2009/04/01/9525555.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2009/04/01/9525555.aspx">TweetDrive creator, Brian Peek</A> with the full details. </P>
<P><STRONG>What is it?</STRONG>&nbsp;<BR>TweetDrive is a .NET application that enables you to use Twitter as a cloud storage backend to share files, musics, photos, anything</P>
<P><STRONG>How does it work?<BR></STRONG>TweetDrive serializes your file into BASE64, splits the file 140 characters at a time and uploads each file chunk to Twitter. </P>
<P><STRONG>Does it really work?<BR></STRONG>Yes! Here's an example Tweet from my TweetDrive account, <A href="https://twitter.com/danielfedrive" mce_href="https://twitter.com/danielfedrive">DanielfeDrive</A></P>

<P><SPAN class="meta entry-meta"><STRONG>Why use TwitterDrive?</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<UL>
<LI><SPAN class="meta entry-meta"><STRONG>Infinite Storage -</STRONG>&nbsp; There are no limits to how many Tweets you can have on Twitter</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN class="meta entry-meta"><STRONG>Leverages Network Effect </STRONG>- Before TwitterDrive, sending files across the network was just from user A to user B. Now communication is open and linked in a social graph. Social file sharing is the future</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN class="meta entry-meta"><STRONG>Open Protocols </STRONG>- Since Twitter has an open API, all data is accessible via XML which means developers will be able to build applications on top of this communication stack.</SPAN></LI></UL>
<P mce_keep="true"><STRONG>Evolution of networking<BR></STRONG>I think what you'll see is that Twitter is the next evolution of message protocols. Traditional communication protocols are point-to-point (TCP/IP request between you and a Web site) and totally closed (the exchange is designed to be private between users, outside of packet sniffers). </P>
<P mce_keep="true">It's not just TCP/IP that is closed, other communication protocols or applications like email, FTP, HTTP, file streaming are closed systems. Twitter is the future of a communication protocol, it's not only completely open, it's a protocol that is <STRONG>social by design. </STRONG></P>
<P mce_keep="true">I suspect that academics will be re-writing networking books to include Twitter as the fifth and perhaps final layer on top of the TCP/IP protocol.</P>

<P mce_keep="true"><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true"><STRONG>The Future <BR></STRONG>This is absolutely just the beginning. Imagine how many applications can be built on top of a totally free, distributed, and social computing cloud. It won't be long before we see&nbsp;the next BitTorrent client or a full blown Web site running using Twitter Cloud Storage. I won't be surprised if the next cloud operating system is distributed and run directly from Twitter. </P></div>
