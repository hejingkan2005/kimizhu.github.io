<div id='content'><p>A customer recently emailed me asking why <a HREF="/danielfe/archive/2005/01/26/361375.aspx">Object Test Bench </a>doesn't work for Web projects and it seems there isn't any documentation on this limitation anywhere. In short, <a HREF="/danielfe/archive/2005/01/26/361375.aspx">Object Test Bench</a>&nbsp;(OTB) does *not* work with Web projects. Due to a bug, OTB still shows as being an enabled feature for Web projects when it should really be disabled. The OTB team is looking to update the docs to call out&nbsp;this limitation so you don't rack your brain trying to figure out what's wrong...</p></div>
