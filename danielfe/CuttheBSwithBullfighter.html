        My favorite new piece of software is <a href="http://www.dc.com/bullfighter/#">Bullfighter</a> from <a href="http://www.dc.com">Deloite
        Touche Consulting</a>. It's a Microsoft Word add-in (2000 or XP) which searches your
        documents for terms like "synergy", "value proposition", and "paradigm" that managers
        and consultants use to sound smarter. I tried this tool on one of our latest <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2003/Jun03/06-17SpamEnforcementPR.asp">press
        releases</a> and found six "BS" hits. Sweet! I only wish they had a web interface
        (or web service interface) where you could point to a URL and get a BS word count
        from a company's "About" page or quarterly earnings.

        On the other side of the net, if you want to bloat your language, visit Vanderbuilt's <a href="http://www.mba.vanderbilt.edu/Mike.Shor/Humor/MBAWriter/">MBA
        Writer</a> . My auto-generated MBA sentence was: <i>"In line with heuristic policy
        flexibility, leveraging customer positions leads the way with the ramifications of
        the final results."</i> I'm making this my Mission Statement.
