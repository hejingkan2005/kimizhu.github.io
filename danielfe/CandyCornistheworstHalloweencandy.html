<div id='content'><p><img src="http://www.jellybeans4u.com/gif.files/candycorn.jpeg" /></p> <p>In our team meeting this week, <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jroxe/">Jay Roxe</a>, the beloved VB Product Manager was nice enough to bring in some Halloween candy. But alas poor Jay brought what is, in <u><em>my opinion</em></u>, the absolute worst Halloween candy there is - <a href="http://www.brachs.com/products/product.asp?base_code=070">candy corn</a>. The nice and well meaning jesture met the wraith of me, BrianKel, and Rick&nbsp;and led to a discussion of&nbsp;what the worst Halloween candy of all time is. Rick even called the 800 number on the back of the Candy Corn wrapper to find out how they stay in business. Louis Black gives his enlightened candy corn theory in <a href="http://www.dvdverdict.com/printer/lewisblackunleashed.php">Unleashed</a> that&nbsp;"<em>all of the candy corn that was ever made was made in 1911</em>" and people have just been reusing the same crappy candy year-after-year.</p> <p>&nbsp;Thanks to the power of Google, I've discovered that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=i+hate+candy+corn">I am not alone </a>in my hatred of candy corn. <a href="http://hcmagazine.com/">Hand Carved Magazine</a> has a <a href="http://hcmagazine.com/magazine.cfm/interactive/messageboard/1,6,0008320,04.html">poll of the worst Halloween treat</a>, and I was delighted to see that people <strong>prefer</strong> "circus peanuts" and "severed body parts" to candy corn. In the poll comments, terremoto*&nbsp;sums up my opinion quite bluntly: <i>man, i can eat raisins, and i can fool myself into eating a circus peanut, but [religious reference], i [expletive] hate candy corn, and even though halloween and candy corn only come once a year, that whole year isn't long enough for me to forget how nasty that crap is.</i></p> <p>Is Candy Corn the biggest culinary joke ever played on an clueless public? Is there anything worse then getting candy corn for Halloween?!! </p> <p><font size="2">* aside:&nbsp;terremoto is spanish for earthquake</font></p></div>
