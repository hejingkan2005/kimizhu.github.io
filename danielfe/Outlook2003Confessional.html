<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Outlook is my one salvation from sheer chaos.&nbsp; As I've complained before several times before (</FONT><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/04/14/113582.aspx"><FONT face=Arial size=2>here</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>, and </FONT><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/04/28/122024.aspx"><FONT face=Arial size=2>here</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>), I'm pretty busy.&nbsp; Outlook is the shining light that keeps me sane.&nbsp; Having taken an internal course on time management a couple of years ago, Managing Action Using Outlook, I realized I wasn't the only one overwhelmed by email at Microsoft.&nbsp; The beginning of the class was a confessional, people were asked <EM>&#8220;How many unread emails you have in your inbox?&#8221;</EM> I thought I was bad with 200 unread emails.&nbsp; One person in the class had 2,000+. I realized I wasn't that bad off.&nbsp; The course taught me to two things - see if&nbsp;the email is actionable, if not, do you need to&nbsp;save it, if not, delete it. If it is actionable,&nbsp;can you reply immediately, if not, put a flag on it and describe the task that needs to be accomplished.&nbsp; The second lesson was to use my Outlook calendar religiously to schedule my time and to color code any events I had..&nbsp; Here's my calendar for&nbsp;April - May before TechEd:</FONT>&nbsp; </P><IMG src="http://www.danfernandez.com/view/view.aspx?ID=22"> 
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><FONT color=#ff0000>Red</FONT> colors indicate high priority items that you would lose sleep over</FONT></FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><FONT color=#000080>Dark Blue</FONT> are regularly schedule meetings</FONT></FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><FONT color=#7fffd4>Light blue</FONT> indicates travel</FONT></FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><FONT color=#008000>Green</FONT> is a personal&nbsp;event</FONT></FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><FONT color=#ffa500>Orange</FONT> is a customer event</FONT></FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><FONT color=#deb887>Brown</FONT> is when I schedule time to work on projects</FONT></FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I also love Outlook 2003 Search Folders. I flag all mail that is urgent (red), I need to respond to but not immediately (yellow), will read later (green), special projects (orange blue), and mail I want to remember to follow up on (purple).&nbsp; The problem is that by flagging mail, I would get a rather large # of emails flagged for follow up.&nbsp; So I created a search folder with just red and&nbsp;yellow flags and any overdue items.&nbsp; I called it Hot Flags, meaning that if I even have five minutes in-between meetings, these are the flags I should work on. My goal is to keep this around 20.&nbsp; As you can see below I'm doing great with unread mail, but I clearly have a lot of actionable mail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Now onto the confessional: How many unread emails do you have in your inbox? What tips (besides the delete key) would you recommend to stay on top of information overflow? </FONT></P></div>
