<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear MacDork,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><A href="http://www.macdork.com/index.php/2005/06/06/visual-studio-200x/">You recently blogged</A> about Visual Studio 2005 quoting an <A href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/06/06/23NNvisualstudio_1.html">article by Paul Krill</A>&nbsp;about how the VS 2005 release date was going to be next year (hence the Visual Studio 200X name of your entry) and about the top 10 features in Visual Studio. </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>To clarify Visual Studio 2005 *is* going to launch&nbsp;the week of November 8th. To be fair, you couldn't have known this as it wasn't announced until the day <U>after</U> you blogged about it, but just thought you'd like to know.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Also, the features highlighted&nbsp;in the </FONT><A href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/06/06/23NNvisualstudio_1.html"><FONT face=Arial size=2>Paul Krill article</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> are not what *<STRONG>Microsoft* </STRONG>considers the best features of Visual Studio. Instead, they are the top requested&nbsp;fixes or suggestions&nbsp;that <STRONG>*customers*</STRONG> voted on in&nbsp;the </FONT><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/feedback/"><FONT face=Arial size=2>MSDN Product Feedback Center</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>. On the Product Feedback center customers can vote&nbsp;on how important a&nbsp;bug/suggestion is and that's how we determine what the top 10 customer requested features are. So&nbsp;to your response (below) about how we shouldn't lead with new icons, *we* didn't decide to make new icons the #1 request on the Product Feedback Center, <STRONG>our customers did.</STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2></P>
<OL>
<LI><EM>The user-driven, top-10 improvement list begins with the ability to deploy updated and new icon sets. This feature enables&nbsp; access to icons that can be distributed with applications. This makes it easier for developers to focus on code, said Brian&nbsp; Keller, a Microsoft product manager on the Visual Studio team.<STRONG> (You sure you wanna lead off w/ “deploy updated … icon sets”?&nbsp; I mean, you ARE Microsoft…. can’t you come up w/ something a *little* more impressive than that?) </STRONG></EM></LI></OL>
<P></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>Now before you say <EM>"Everything I’ve heard (perhaps anecdotally) about .Net points to a hodge-podge of technologies"</EM> why don't you try it out for yourself? No Seriously. </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>Since you sound like a Web developer given your astuteness with cross-browser issues when describing the other features, how about you&nbsp;download and try </FONT><A href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/vwd/default.aspx"><FONT face=Arial size=2>Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition </FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>and take the </FONT><A href="http://beta.asp.net/guidedtour/"><FONT face=Arial size=2>VWD Guided Tour</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>. While VWD isn't designed for enterprise developers&nbsp;(you'll find architecture tools, unit and load testing in Visual Studio Team System <A href="https://www.getthebetas.com/profile.aspx">which you can order for free from here and we'll even pay S&amp;H</A>) you can still take it for a spin and honestly evaluate what it's like to develop applications using Visual Studio and the .NET Framework. At least keep an open mind about our technology -&nbsp;<A href="http://jroller.com/page/rickross/">Rick Ross</A>&nbsp;got a chance to look at what we're doing first hand <A href="http://www.javalobby.org/members-only/summit/mts.pdf">when he came to Redmond</A>&nbsp;and had some positive things to say:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><EM>First, ASP.NET 2.0 is truly impressive. It drives the state of the art forward with a rich set of high-level modular components for creating and deploying web applications. Most of us have hassled with creating yet another member registration or login block in a web application, but ASP.NET 2.0 makes those hassles a thing of the past. You can tell that Microsoft sets its product development priorities by listening to where its customers feel pain. Of course, I have no idea how much pain the customers will feel in their bank accounts to have this power, but the technology is simply outstanding. </EM></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><EM>Second, Visual Studio is a powerhouse that makes the other Microsoft products possible, and the 2005 version (also called "Whidbey") has a ton of new features that make .NET development easy and fast.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Now Rick isn't leaving the Java world anytime soon, but he's a developer first and he seems willing to at least hear what we have to offer and encourages others to be open-minded: </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><EM>"I am encouraging mutual respect and a dialogue to keep the possibility for progress alive. Frozen hatred is not in the best interests of the Java developer community."...</EM></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><EM>"I want it to be explicitly clear that I am NOT advocating any Java developer to abandon Java. I am only saying that we should consider, as a community, treating our peer developers in the Microsoft world and elsewhere with more respect and open-mindedness.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Try it out&nbsp;and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/feedback/">send us *your* feedback</A>, it might&nbsp;even make it into Paul's next article...</FONT></P></div>
