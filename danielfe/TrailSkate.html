<div id='content'><p>I have no time, not even for hockey. I've missed two games because of work and have yet to have a free weekend to heat mold my <a href="http://2004.missionhockey.com/MissionHockey/ROLLER/Roller2005/pop.html">Mission Helium He950 skates</a>. These things are so damn light and fast, they ought to compensate for my complete lack of dedication to working out or playing hockey. Assuming I can get them to fit right and that's where the heat molding comes in. Speaking of skating, I want to go <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/trailskate-023148.php">off-road skating</a> with the TrailSkate. This look shweeet.</p></div>
